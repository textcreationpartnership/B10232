            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Publick</hi> will be very much obliged to you, if you continue, (as I hope you will, and which I take the freedom to exhort you to) making it ſuch like Preſents. For my own part I find therein a very great Edification, and with with all my heart it lay in my power to manifeſt it to you by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual ſervices. I beſeech you to be perſuaded of this truth, and that you would preſerve me the honour of your friendſhip, which I ſhall ever look upon as very much to my advantage. I take my leave, praying God he would continue to pour upon you his holy Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and aſſuring you that I am,</p>

And truly there is no other Book ſave the Apoſtolick Epiſtles, that intermingles theſe two.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, I here preſent thee with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on this moſt excellent Book of <hi>Lukes,</hi> which plainly unfolds the meaning that is wrapt up in the words, and that agreeable to the Letter. In compoſing whereof I have made uſe of both what I could find in the Sacred Fountains of the Scriptures, and what I have taken notice of in ſearching out thoſe Monuments, which the Hebrew Rabbies &amp; Fathers of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have left behind them, and what I have obſerved in reading over, and carefully examining many and ſeveral Writers, as well Ancient as Modern, &amp; what Talent of Prudence and Knowledge God the Donor of all good things has beſtowed upon me.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192139:5"/>
            <p>In this my Commentary, as in thoſe which I formerly publiſhed on <hi>Matthew, Mark, Solomons</hi> Song, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes,</hi> &amp; the <hi>12</hi> leſſer Prophets, I for the moſt part uſe the Ancient Latin Verſion of the Scriptures, as being that which I am beſt acquainted with: But I always diligently remark what it differs from the Original Texts, the Hebrew and Greek. I vindicate thoſe places which Hereticks abuſe with ſome pretence, eſpecially Papiſts, from their abuſe and corruption. I likewiſe briefly make ſeveral profitable Obſervations out of Philology, Hiſtory, Geography &amp; Grammar, where I ſee it neceſſary either for the Confirmation or Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Sacred Hiſtory of the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Courteous Reader, if thou meeteſt with any thing in theſe my Obſervations, that is skilfully ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; aſcribe that, not to me, but to God the Fountain of all goodneſs; to me only what my hand has not well penned, and what my mind has not well conceived. Moreover, if I have erred in any place, as in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may eaſily happen, I neither ſtubbornly refuſe to profeſs my Error, nor to be better inſtructed. I deſire to learn what I am ignorant of, and willingly offer my ſelf to be a Scholar to any, <hi>provided</hi> (to uſe <hi>Jeroms</hi> phraſe) <hi>that he inſtruct, and do not detract; for there is nothing ſo eaſie as for anidle and lazy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to carp at other mens Labours and Watchings.</hi> In the mean while, Candid Reader, peruſe my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſuch as they are, and joyn your earneſt prayers to God with mine, that he may make them profitable to his Church; which when I ſhall ſee performed, I ſhall never repent of my Labours and Studies.</p>

            <p>This Golden Book quite through diſplays the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Providence of God in gathering together to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192139:7"/>himſelf, and preſerving his Church. It opens and explains what was the Beginning and Riſe of the Chriſtian Religion, after what manner the Apoſtles began the Preaching of the Goſpel; how ſtrenuouſly and couragiouſly a few obſcure, unarmed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible perſons oppoſed by the power of the whole World, while all the Potentates of thoſe Ages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd their Forces to oppreſs the Goſpel, relying only upon the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit and Truth, indefatigably defended the Faith of Chriſt, refuſing no Labours, nor Dangers, but combating with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken conſtancy againſt all oppoſition, till at length they became Victors, and the Power of God magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently triumph'd over all the Pride of the Earth, under the Ignominy of the Croſs. The Chapters of this Book are twenty eight; the principal parts are four. The firſt of which in the firſt eight Chapters, ſets down the Original and Progreſs of the New Teſtament-Church among the Jews. The next from the ninth to the ſixteenth, declares how greatly the Church was multiplied and propagated among the Gentiles. The third part from the ſixteenth to the twentieth, relates the ſeveral Travels and Voyages of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to his very laſt Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The laſt, from the twentieth to the end, gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with what perſeverance St. <hi>Paul</hi> endured a thouſand Troubles, Hardſhips and Indignities; with what patience he ſurmounted the raging Floods of Perſecution; and laſtly, how mildly, and with what an equal temper he carry'd himſelf in the midſt of all manner of Calumnies and Reproaches, and all ſorts of Miſeries.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192139:17"/>he ſhall come from thence, and from no other place, to judge the quick and the dead; And ſo ſhall he come, according to the Teſtimony of that Angelic Voice, as he was ſeen to aſcend into Heaven; that is, in the ſame form and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Fleſh; to which he gave immortality, but took away nothing of its nature. Yet he is not to be thought to be every where diffus'd, according to that form. For we muſt be careful, that we do not ſo uphold the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of this man, as to take away the reality of his Body.

For the moſt true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks alſo of us, that we live, move, and have our being in God, yet are we not every where as he is. But that man is after another manner in God, and that God is after another manner in man, after a manner both ſingular and proper. For God and Man is one Perſon, and one Chriſt Jeſus is both.

The moſt learned <hi>Knatchbull</hi> would have the Greek words tranſlated, <hi>That he may enter upon his place.</hi> As if the ſenſe were, that the perſon whom thou ſhalt chuſe, may ſucceed into the place of him that has deſerted it, that is, into the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Judas,</hi> and that <hi>his own</hi> may be taken for <hi>his,</hi> the ſame worthy Author proves out of <hi>Oecumenius;</hi> as <hi>Budaeus</hi> affirms the Pronoun <hi>Suum</hi> to be frequently us'd inſtead of <hi>Ejus</hi> by <hi>Cicero,</hi> in imitation of the Greeks.

Patriarch is a compound Greek word of <hi>Patria,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Family,</hi> and <hi>Arche, Beginning.</hi> However every Father of a Family, is not called a Patriarch by the <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> but only they who in Hebrew are call'd the <hi>Heads, or chief of the Fathers; that is, the Fathers of the Fathers of a Family, and the Founders of the whole Family and Kindred.</hi> They are called <hi>the Heads of the Fathers,</hi>

               <p>The Sacred Ceremony of Baptiſm is not to be performed by the ſprinkling only or pouring on of a little Water, but by the plunging of the whole body of them that are to be baptiz'd; as firſt, the

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21.</note> for that St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſerts, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine end of Baptiſm, was not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the inward waſhing away from ſin; which may be repreſented by any exteriour waſhing of the body; but to expreſs the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, as alſo our own, and our belief of both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, as the moſt famous Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbul</hi> in his learned Notes printed at <hi>Oxford, anno Dom.</hi> 1677. with the licence of the Vice-chancellour, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe words tho long, I cannot but tranſcribe, they are ſo full of truth and weight. <q>The ſenſe and meaning of <hi>Peter</hi> is, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> That Baptiſm which now ſaves us by Water, that is, by the aſſiſtance of Water, and is Antitypical to the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> does not ſignify the laying down of the filth of the Fleſh in the Water, but the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a good Conſcience toward God, while we are plung'd in the Water, which is the true uſe of Water in Baptiſm, thereby to teſtify our belief in the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that there is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:192139:45"/>a manifeſt Antitheſis between theſe words <hi>By Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and, <hi>by the Reſurrection,</hi> nor is the Elegancy of it diſpleaſing. As if he ſhould ſay, The Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> not the Flood, was the Type of Baptiſm, and Baptiſm was an Antitype of the Ark, not as Baptiſm is a waſhing away of the filth of the Fleſh by Water, wherein it anſwers not at all to the Ark; but as it is the Covenant of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward God by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in the belief of which Reſurrection we are ſav'd, as they were ſav'd in the Ark of Noah. For the Ark and Baptiſm were both a Type and Figure of the Reſurrection, ſo that the proper end of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ought not to be underſtood as if it were a Sign of the waſhing away of ſin, altho it be thus often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken metonymically in the New Teſtament, and by the Fathers, but a particular ſignal of the Reſurrection by faith in the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Of which Baptiſm is a Lively and Emphatical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, as alſo was the Ark out of which <hi>Noah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned forth as from the Sepulcher to a new life, and therefore not unaptly called by <hi>Philo, The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the New Creation.</hi> And then the Whales belly out of which <hi>Jonas</hi> after a burial of three days was ſet at liberty: And the Cloud and the Red-ſea in which the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to have been baptiz'd; that is, not waſhed, but buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for they were all Types of the ſame thing as Baptiſm, not of the waſhing away of ſin, but of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and our own. To which truth the Apoſtles, the Fathers, the Scholaſticks, and all Interpreters agree. The thing is ſo apparent as not to need any Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but becauſe there are not a few, who do not vulgarly teach this Doctrine, it will not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, to produce ſome of thoſe innumerable teſtimonies that I may not ſeem to ſpeak without
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:192139:46"/>book. And firſt let us begin with St. <hi>Paul:</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.3, 4. <hi>See alſo,</hi> Col. 2.12.</note> Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptiz'd into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptiz'd into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the Father of Glory, ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.29.</note> Elſe what ſhall they do who are baptiz'd for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? <q>As if he had ſaid, If there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, why are we baptiz'd? In vain does the Church uſe the Symbol of Baptiſm, if there be no Reſurrection. The like Teſtimonies frequently occur among the Fathers.</q> That believing in his Death we may be made partakers of his Reſurrection by Baptiſm.

                  </note> He calls Baptiſm the paſſage of the Sea; for it was the flight of death cauſed by the Water. To be baptiz'd and plung'd, and ſo to return up, and riſe out of the Water,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom.</note> is a Symbol of the deſcent into Hell,

<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Immerſion is a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death and Burial. <q>Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are the Teſtimonys which might be added; but theſe I think ſufficient to prove that Baptiſin is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:192139:46"/>an Image of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, (from whence we acknowledge the Myſtery of our Religion,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> his Deity and Humanity) and of all the faithful who are baptiz'd in his faith, from death in ſin to newneſs of life, which if they lead in this world, they have a moſt aſſured hope, that being dead they ſhall hereafter riſe to Glory with Chriſt. Which things if they be ſo, I beſeech you, what affinity is to be ſeen between a burial and a waſhing, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Baptiſm ſhould be thought to draw its Original from Jewiſh Lotions and Divings? For if it were true, that the end of our Baptiſm were to ſignifie a waſhing, or ablution, or if it were true that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did admit their Children or Proſelytes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Church by the adminiſtration of any diving, as it is aſſerted by many learned perſons of late days, I confeſs it might be a probable Argument that our Baptiſm was fetcht from the divings of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But to prove that our Baptiſm is indeed an Image of Death and Reſurrection, not of waſhing, enough has been ſaid. But as to their Argument, who would have our Baptiſm to be deriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d from the Jewiſh Lotions, as there is nothing of certainty in it, ſo is it ſo far from being grounded upon any authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there are hardly any footſteps to be found thereof in the Old-Teſtament. They deduce the original of Baptiſm from the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>to waſh</hi> or <hi>cleanſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 19.10.</note> But the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> if I am not deceived, make uſe of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which ſignifies Immerſion, thereby making it appear that they owe the notion of that word to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or rather to the Chriſtians. For what affinity is there between Lotion and Immerſion? Beſides that, we find ſome to have been baptiz'd in Sand. But the thing is ſo uncertain, that it cannot be ſaid of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:192139:47"/>
                     <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that there were not ſeveral among them, who differed very much about this matter; for in the very Text cited by the forementioned learned men, <hi>Rabbi Eliezer,</hi> expreſsly contradicts <hi>Rabbi Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah,</hi> who was the firſt that I know of, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted this ſort of Baptiſm among the <hi>Jews.</hi> For <hi>Rabbi Eliezer,</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> if he did not live before him, aſſerts that a Proſelyte Circumciz'd and not Baptiz'd was a true Proſelyte, for ſo we read of the Patriarchs <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob,</hi> that they were Circumciz'd, but not Baptiz'd. But <hi>Rabbi Joſhua</hi> affirms, that he who was Baptiz'd, not he who was Circumciz'd, was a true Proſelyte. To whom ſhall I give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? To <hi>Eliezer,</hi> who aſſerts what the Scripture confirms, or to <hi>Joſhua</hi> who affirms what is no where to be found in Scripture? But the <hi>Rabbins</hi> upheld <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>'s ſide, and what wonder was it? for it made for their Buſineſs, that is, for the honour of the Jewiſh Religion, that the Chriſtians ſhould borrow their Ceremonies from them. But when I ſee men of great learning in theſe times fetching the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of truth from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> I cannot but heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a little.</q> For whence was the <hi>Talmud</hi> ſent us? <hi>They are the words of</hi> Buxtorf <hi>in his Synagoga Judaica,</hi> that we ſhould give ſo much credit thereto, that from thence we ſhould believe that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> either can or ought to be underſtood? <q>Much leſs the Goſpel to which they were profeſs'd enemies. For the <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a <hi>Labyrinth of Errors, and the foundation of Jewiſh Fables.</hi> It was brought to perfection, and held for Authentick five hundred years after Chriſt; therefore it is unreaſonable to reſt upon the teſtimony of it. And that which moves me moſt, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to omit all the Fathers that lived before the <hi>Talmud</hi> was finiſhed, who was alſo a <hi>Jew,</hi> and contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Eliezer,</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:192139:47"/>who alſo wrote in particular of the Rites, Cuſtoms, and Acts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is altogether ſilent in this matter; ſo that it is an Argument to me next to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that two ſuch eminent perſons, both <hi>Jews,</hi> and living at the ſame time, the one ſhould poſitively deny, the other make no mention of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm among the Jews. Beſides, if Baptiſm in the modern ſenſe, were in uſe among the Jews in Ancient times, why did the Phariſees ask <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, <hi>Why doſt thou Baptize,
<note place="margin">Jo. 1.25.</note> if thou art not Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias, <hi>nor that Prophet?</hi> Do they not plainly intimate that Baptiſm was not in uſe before, &amp; that it was a received Opinion among them, that there ſhould be no Baptiſm, till either Chriſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or that Prophet came. How then there ſhould be ſo much affinity between Baptiſm, and the Divings of the Jews, that the one ſhould be ſucceſſive to the other by any right or pretence, is altogether, I confeſs, beyond my Faith. They ſay that <hi>Arrian</hi> calls a Jew <hi>dipt;</hi> but I, as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator does, believe that he ſpake confuſedly, and that he rather meant a Chriſtian then a Jew, as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place he calls the Chriſtians <hi>Galileans;</hi> likewiſe <hi>Lubin</hi> upon <hi>Juvenal. Sat.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 14. obſerves, that there by Jews, are meant Chriſtians, who being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd the City by <hi>Domitian,</hi> were forced to betake themſelves to the Woods that were ſacred to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Superſtitions. Therefore that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I ſay with <hi>Alexander de Hales, Tinctio,</hi> that is, Dipping, is the formal cauſe of Baptiſm.</q> Thus far the moſt learned, and highly deſerving of Sacred Writings, Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> Knight and Baronet. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius, that the Ancients made uſe of the word</hi> Tingere, <hi>inſtead of</hi> Baptizare, <hi>is not to be wonder'd at, ſeeing the Latin word,</hi> Tingere, <hi>is properly the ſame in ſignification, and frequently us'd for</hi> Merſare, <hi>to dip, or to plunge.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:192139:48"/>
               <p>Hence it is, that <hi>Magnus</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> doubts whether they are to be accounted rightly initiated Chriſtians, who are only initiated by ſprinkling, or pouring, in caſe of ſickneſs or weakneſs. To which <hi>Cyprian</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <q>That whatever benefit accrews by the ſaving Sacrament, that ſprinkling, or pouring upon, neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo inforcing, and God indulging, afford to the Believer. And this is the ſenſe and Law of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not that it be indifferent, but that all Infants be dipt, except in the caſe of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then ſprinkling is permitted. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although in caſes of Need and Charity, the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not want ſome good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the beſt times to countenance that permiſſion, yet we are to follow her command, becauſe that command is not only according to the meaning and intent of the word, <hi>Baptize,</hi> but agrees with the Myſtery of the Sacrament itſelf. For we are buried with him in Baptiſm, ſaith the Apoſtle. The old Man is buried, and drowned in the immerſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, and when the baptized Perſon is lifted up from the water, it repreſents the Reſurrection of the new Man to newneſs of life. In this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the contrary Cuſtom, being not only againſt an Eccleſiaſtical Law, but againſt the Analogy, and myſterious ſignification of the Sacrament, is not to be complyed with, unleſs in ſuch caſes that can be of themſelves ſufficient to juſtify a liberty in a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Ceremony; that is, a caſe of neceſſity.</q> Thus the learned <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Down.</hi>

Alſo a Paralytick Jew, who having long tryed the Phyſicians Art in vain, bethought himſelf of the application of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Baptiſm; being brought in his Bed to the Font, or dipping place at the appointment of <hi>Atticus,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in the Conſtantinopolitan See, was plung'd over head and ears; which being done, he was immediately freed from his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and reſtored to perfect health.

To celebrate private Love-Feaſts, the richer ſort invited the Brethren to their houſes, and then according to cuſtom celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lords Supper after the end of the Love-Feaſt. From which Love-Feaſts, the Cuftom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd a long time of bleſſing and receiving the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt from houſe to houſe. In the fourth Century it appears to have been ſtill Adminiſter'd by ſeveral Biſhops and Presbyters in private Houſes. Which by their laſt Canon, ſave one, did prohibit by the Fathers the Council of <hi>Laodicea Ordaining that no oblations
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:192139:54"/>ſhould be celebrated in private houſes.</hi> This was in the Year 364. But the Fathers of the Synod of <hi>Gangra,</hi> which was ſome twenty years before that of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi> condemn'd <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> becauſe he would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the private Love-Feaſts of that ſort, at which, without doubt they received alſo the Sacrament.</q>

                  <hi>deſpiſes theſe cordial entertainers of the poor at their Love-Feaſts, who out of reſpect invited the Brethren to their houſes; &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes out of contempt to be partakers of ſuch biddings to Supper, let him be an</hi> Anathema. <q>For it is to thoſe private Love-Feaſts that the Canon of the <hi>Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Council without queſtion has reference, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Oblations in private houſes. For in thoſe Love-Feaſts, which were only entertainments of private Perſons, inviting the faithful Brethren to their Houſes, was alſo celebrated the <hi>Oblation,</hi> that is, the Euchariſt. For with the Brethren, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited alſo the Biſhops or Elders, by whom, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom of that time, the Bread and Wine was bleſſed into the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Canon did not take away the private Love-Feaſts, but only the cuſtom of Communicating the Lords Supper therein. For in the 28 Canon of the ſame Synod, the Clergy and Laity invited to the Love-Feaſts, are forbid to take any parts of the Victuals; that is to ſay, according to the Greek way of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to carry any parts home to their own houſes. So they were not forbid to go to the Love-Feaſts, but to carry any parts away. By the ſame Council the people were reſtrained from celebrating their Love-Feaſts in the Temples, in which publick Love-Feaſts moſt certain it is, that the Euchariſt was wont to be taken.</q>

                  <q>For, <hi>ſaith</hi> Lightfoot <hi>in his Hebraick Hours upon this place,</hi> the Diſcourſe and Meaning of <hi>Peter</hi> relates to preaching: for he ſhall ſend you Chriſt by preaching, as he was preached before. Now you are to underſtand, that the Apoſtle in this Diſcourſe ſpeaks of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold time. 1. Before the coming of Chriſt he was promulgated by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by all the Prophets from <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. When he came; at what time God ſhewed him to the world,
<note place="margin">v. 26.</note> raiſing him up a Saviour, then he ſent him to you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:192139:61"/>firſt of all, by his Doctrine to convert you from your iniquities. 3. When he aſcended into Heaven there to remain; yet then he ſhall ſend him to you again upon repentance, by the preaching of his word, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was made known by preaching.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That is, Jeſus, who is the Meſſias or Chriſt promiſed in the Law and the Prophets, for the Redemption and Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive.</hi> Theſe words carry an Ambiguous ſenſe, if you look upon the Grammatical Conſtruction; and may ſignify as well that Heaven is received by Jeſus, as that Jeſus is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Heaven. But when you conſider the meaning of the Speaker, and the context of the words, it is not probable they ſhould admit of the firſt Expoſition. For <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by whoſe importunity Chriſt was put to death, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them from expecting his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſence upon Earth,
<note place="margin">1 Epiſt. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Who,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>is gone into Heaven, and ſits at the Right-hand of God, and whom the Heaven muſt receive,</hi> not as a Priſon, but as his own moſt glorious Palace, and Manſion more befitting his Divine Majeſty, than the Earth, wherein he lived during the time of his Mortality. Now by <hi>Heaven is meant not that part of the Sky which is viſible to our ſight, but the Third Heaven, Paradice, the Seat and Habitation of God, that inacceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light which God inhabits. For Chriſt aſcended above all the viſible Heavens,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.10.</note> and ſits at the Right-hand of the Majeſty of God in the higheſt Altitudes, to prepare a place for us in the Houſe of his Father,</hi> John 14.2.</p>

Therefore do not continue in the Errour of the Generality of our Erring People, to expect his perſonal preſence upon Earth.</hi> Hence it is apparent that <hi>Peter</hi> meant the time that Jeſus ſhould abide in Heaven, according to what he with the reſt of the Apoſtles had heard from the Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As if he had ſaid,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>AND the Captain of the Temple.</hi> That is, who was the chief of all that had the charge of guarding the Temple. For every night the Temple was guarded by 24 Companies, that kept watch in 24 places: To wit, the Prieſts in three places, and the Levites in all the reſt. Now that the Chiefs or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of theſe Watches are ſignified by the name of Captains, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.40. the famous <hi>Lightfoot</hi> does no wiſe Queſtion.

<note place="margin">Mat. 27.65.</note> that of <hi>Pilate</hi> referred, <hi>Ye have a Watch.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Ye have Watches of your own, ſend ſome of thoſe to guard the Sepulcher. To this the ſame Author adds, <hi>I take the Captain of the Temple diſtinctly and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency ſo called, to be the ſame with the Man of the Mountains Houſe, that is the Governour of the Mountains Temple, who was the chief of all the chief Officers of the Watches. For, as</hi> Maimonides obſerves, <hi>there was one chief Ruler who commanded all the Watches, who was called</hi> the Governour of the Mountains Houſe. <hi>He went the Rounds all night, having lighted Torches car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before him. And when he met with any of the Watch that ſtood not upright upon his Feet, the Captain ſaid to him, Peace be with thee: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which if he found him aſleep he waked him with his Cudgel. He had alſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to burn the Garments of him that ſlept. Therefore it was a common ſaying at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>What's the ſtir here?

<note place="margin">

His Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> was now High-prieſt and Father of the Sanhedrin. For though the Chief Prieſts were generally in the great Sanhedrin, yet they are commonly named in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by reaſon of their great Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The High Prieſt.</hi> Since it is plain that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was advanced to the High-Prieſthood by <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> about the fourth year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> before <hi>Pilate</hi> came to the Government of Jury; and removed by <hi>Vitelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> toward the end of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Reign, when <hi>Pilate</hi> left <hi>Judea;</hi> it may be deſervedly queſtioned, why <hi>Annas</hi> here, and <hi>Luke</hi> 3.2. is called High-prieſt? To which <hi>Caſaubon</hi> anſwers, becauſe that <hi>Annas</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready born that high dignity. <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſay, that <hi>Annas</hi> was ſo called, becauſe he was next to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and his <hi>Segan, Vicar,</hi> or Lieutenant General in all the Sacred Miniſtry. But <hi>Baronius</hi> ſays, it was becauſe he was <hi>Prince</hi> of the great <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſays <hi>Blondel</hi> a perſon of inexhauſted Learning, <hi>there were among the</hi> Jews <hi>not only many Prieſts, but many Chief Prieſts, when</hi> David <hi>had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed the Poſterity of</hi> Aaron <hi>into twenty four Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who were to officiate in the ſacred Miniſtry by turns. Over every one of theſe Families there was a Chief, who is called</hi> The Head of the Paternal Houſe, <hi>in the Talmud.
<note place="margin">Mat. 2.3.16.21.20.18.21.19, 23, 25. Mark 8.31.10.33. Jer. 29.1.</note> The ſame perſon was called Chief Prieſt in reſpect of his Claſſis. Hence it is, that they are called</hi> Chief Prieſts <hi>in the Goſpel, and in</hi> Jeremy Elders of the Prieſts.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:192139:65"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Over theſe</hi> 24. <hi>Families were two Chiefs, of which the firſt was called properly the</hi> High Prieſt, <hi>and many times ſingly</hi> Prieſt. <hi>His Vicar might indeed have been numbered among the Chief Prieſts at the beginning, but whether he alone by himſelf were at any time called</hi> High-prieſt, <hi>I much queſtion. Certainly</hi> Bullinger <hi>ought to have proved it, before he affirmed that</hi> Annas <hi>was called</hi> High-prieſt, <hi>becauſe he was the High-prieſts Vicar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Scripture this Vicar is called</hi> the Second Prieſt, <hi>not the firſt.
<note place="margin">2 Kings 25.18. Jer. 52.24.</note> The</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee <hi>Paraphraſt renders it,</hi> Segan. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read in the</hi> Talmud, <hi>that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and High-prieſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joma. fol.</hi> 30.</note> officiated according to their Lots. Not that they were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by Lots, but that they diſtributed one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Lots ſeveral of the Sacerdotal Functions. <hi>And a little after,</hi> as often as it happened that the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> was ſuſpended from his Function, the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> was ordered to officiate for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of the</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.4. <hi>it ſeems that it might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that there were many Second Prieſts, ſeeing it is ſaid there in the plural number,</hi> the Prieſts of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond order, <hi>but the</hi> Chaldee <hi>Paraphraſt tranſlates in that place,</hi> And the <hi>Segan in the</hi> Singular, becauſe often the plural number is uſed for the ſingular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Annas <hi>was Vicar to</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>as</hi> Bullinger <hi>will have it, how comes it to paſs that by the Evangeliſts</hi> Annas <hi>is always ſet before</hi> Caiaphas? <hi>In the</hi> 2 Chron. 31.12. <hi>The ruler over the Treaſury of the Sanctuary is called</hi> Nagid, Ruler, Cononiah, <hi>and</hi> Shimei <hi>his Brother the next. Were it proper there that</hi> Shimei <hi>ſhould be called</hi> Nagid, <hi>and be ſet before</hi> Cononiah?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> Annas <hi>were called High-prieſt, becauſe he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly officiated in that dignity, how comes it to paſs, that among ſo many others, who had born the ſame Office, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Annas <hi>ſhould be mentioned? How comes it to paſs that he that had been High-prieſt ſhould be always ſet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:192139:66"/>before him that is yet High-prieſt? Theſe</hi> Expontifices <hi>were indeed called</hi> Pontiffs <hi>for honours ſake, but never any publick acts were marked with their names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore here I prefer far</hi> Baronius <hi>before</hi> Caſaubon, Scaliger, <hi>or</hi> Bullinger <hi>either, who aſſerts</hi> Annas <hi>to be called High-prieſt, becauſe he was Preſident of the great Sanhedrin, who by the Hebrews was called</hi> Naſi. <hi>And the perſon next to him was called,</hi> the Father of the Houſe of Juſtice. <hi>Theſe two Chiefs of the Sanhedrin, were both ſtiled</hi> Prieſts, <hi>becauſe they were over many Priests. Hence if I miſtake not, we read that the Sons of</hi> David <hi>were</hi> Prieſts,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 8.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that is, according to the</hi> Chaldee <hi>Paraphraſt,</hi> Grandees; <hi>and indeed they were Grandees, becauſe both</hi> David's <hi>Sons were Preſidents or Princes of the great Sanhedrin.</hi> Thus far <hi>Blondel,</hi> which will be more plain out of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words of <hi>Selden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We are to underſtand, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> that thoſe Titles of <hi>High</hi> or <hi>Chief-prieſts,</hi> which denote a certain Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Dignity in the form of the Jewiſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that time much impaired, denoted either a Sacred Function, or Civil Dignity, which the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt enjoy'd above the reſt. Where mention is made together of the High-prieſt, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Function proper to the Dignity, there that very perſon is ſignified who obtain'd the peculiar Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, the High-Prieſthood derived together with the Sacred Function from <hi>Aaron.</hi> But where mention is made not at all of the Sacred Function, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Civil Government of the High-prieſts, <hi>that is,</hi> as they governed with an Authority limited by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as in many places of the Goſpel, and of the Acts of the Apoſtles; there it ſeems very probable that the High-prieſts are deſigned by that Title, not as they were advanced to the Sacred Dignity, but as they preſided in the Civil Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. Such a difference concerning the Title
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:192139:66"/>is to be obſerved in ſome ancient Synods, where mention is made of Counts. Now the Dignity of Counts was altogether belonging to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Court, and as it had no reference to the Synods being a Dignity within the Emperours Palace or Court; ſo as the Counts had in the Synods the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that Title has no relation at all to the Palace or to its firſt Notion. But we meet in the firſt Action of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> with theſe two Phraſes, <hi>Give the Counts,</hi> and <hi>the Counts entered in.</hi> Where the notion of Counts however a word generally uſed, ſhews that ſingular and particular dignity in reſpect of which, they who were Counts preſided in the Council, inſtead of the Emperours; not at all its vulgar acception for that other digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which they belonged to the Emperours Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Inſomuch that I think that by the High-prieſts they were no more underſtood as High-prieſts in reſpect of their Sacred Function, where they are mentioned in the places ſpeaking concerning the Civil Adminiſtration, than we underſtand by Counts in that Synod, their particular dignity either in the Council-houſe, or elſewhere in the Emperours Palace. Hence with licence to conjecture I ſhould think, that <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> both together ſtiled High-prieſts by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> were not ſo ſtiled to note their dignity of the Sacred Function, but their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government, as well as of the others they are joyned with for that year there mentioned. That is to ſay, that <hi>Annas</hi> was Prince of the Sanhedrin, as <hi>Baronius</hi> will have it, and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Let us ſuppoſe that there were ſuch two juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Counts in the Synod before mentioned or in any other, for we hear of Counts alſo in the Synod of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> If any one had noted the year of <hi>Caeſars</hi> reign in the Acts of the Synod, and had added for examples ſake, under <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:192139:67"/>Counts, certainly no man would have believed them to have been there named Counts, from that Juriſdiction they enjoy'd according to the Vulgar and Original notion of the word, but from the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction they had obtained ſince, as according to the cuſtom of that Age, ſome others being dignified with the Title of Counts. Which being admitted, it is eaſy to judge why in the Goſpel <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> help mutually ſo much one another in their proceedings againſt Chriſt, both under the Title of High-prieſts. That is to ſay, as they by reaſon of their Dignity, and kindred of the High-prieſt, as then the times were, preſided in the manner aforeſaid in the Sanhedrin, where the Proſecution commenced. Which may not be unfitly ſaid of <hi>Annas</hi> the High-prieſt, and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> with other Senators of the Sanhedrin mentioned in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. So that the reaſon is eaſily given, why <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> by <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaid at that time to have been inveſted with the Sacred Dignity as the Succeſſor of <hi>Aaron,</hi> is ſet after <hi>Annas.</hi> For the Father was alway ſecond to the Prince of the Sanhedrin. Neither was the Office of Prince or Father of the Sanhedrin perpetual, but tranſlated from one to another, as occaſion required. Which is apparent out of the <hi>Talmudick</hi> Title,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>chap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Horjaoth</hi> and other treatiſes of the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.</hi> And perhaps at that time it was Annual, leſt the Prolongation of that Authority might be a prejudice to the reſt of the Kindred of the High-prieſt. And hence perhaps that other queſtion is to be reſolved concerning the High-prieſthood of <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> noted by his year, in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John.</hi> For as the plural number of High-prieſts, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Relations of the Adminiſtration of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, ſignified Judges and Preſidents of Courts, as it has been ſaid already, ſo the Title of High-prieſt in the ſingular number with the account of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:192139:67"/>his year may ſeem to denote the Prince of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin.</q> So that in the 15th.
<note place="margin">Luke 3.1, 2.</note> year of <hi>Tiberius, Annas</hi> was Prince, and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was Father of the Sanhedrin. <q>But in the Paſſion year <hi>Annas</hi> was Father, and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Prince. Afterwards <hi>Annas</hi> as being moſt eminent among his People again Prince, and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> Father, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. And certainly <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-prieſt; <hi>Acts</hi> 23.5. where he preſides in the Sanhedrin, is acknowledged Prince of the People, which perhaps was the ſame thing with Prince of the Sanhedrin. There are many other places in the New Teſtament to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded perhaps by ſuch an obſervation. Nor let any one object, that thereby it might come to paſs, that the High-prieſt advanced to the Dignity of the Sacred Function, ſhould give place to the Prince of the Sanhedrin in the time of his being onely Father, and conſequently be inferiour to him in that ſtate of Commonwealth. For that was ſo true, as to the Civil Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which we diſcourſe, that the High-prieſt himſelf was not only obnoxious to the Juriſdiction of the great Sanhedrin, but alſo of the inferiour Sanhedrins, as is frequently to be ſeen in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> and other writings of the Jews. So that it is no wonder, that he as a member of the Great Sanhedrin, ſhould be but next in authority to the Prince of the Sanhedrin. It is to be noted alſo, that the moſt learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> inſtruct us, that the two names of thoſe by whoſe hands in former times their Oral Law was delivered,
<note place="margin">Juchaſin, <hi>fol,</hi> 159.</note> are ſo to be underſtood in the ſolemn num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of them, that the one denotes the Prince, the other the Father of the Sanhedrin. So that it is no new thing to believe that theſe two were more particularly joyn'd then the reſt, and were named together in matters of great moment. And fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:192139:68"/>among the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> mention is made of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and of ſuch others with their Sanhedrin, in the management of buſineſs, as if then they were cuſtomarily to be taken for Princes of the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin.

'For thus, <hi>ſaith the famous Divine of our Age,</hi> Stephen Curcellaeus, <q>the Apoſtles were deſirous to ſhew their confidence in God, by openly profeſſing that all the endeavours of the Enemies of Chriſt to diſturb the propagation of the Goſpel, ſhould be of no effect; nor ſhould they be able to hinder, but that what God had decreed ſhould be done by Chriſt and his Servants for the Salvation of the World, ſhould be duly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and executed.

But whence cometh this willingneſs, except that God change our heart, that of ſtony it may become fleſhy, of hard, and ſtubborn, tractable: and laſtly, of crooked, ſtraight? But this is done, when Chriſt by his Spirit renews us; neither is this the gift of one moment, but muſt be daily increaſed all our life, till we fully adhere to God, which will be at laſt, when we ſhall have put off our fleſh. It is indeed a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Repentance, when a man who firſt was averſe from God, renouncing the World, and himſelf, begins a new life. But becauſe (though once upon the way) we are far from
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:192139:84"/>the mark, we muſt daily be advancing. Both which we obtain by Chriſt. For even as he beginneth Repentance in us, ſo he gives us perſeverance. This is indeed an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Grace: but it would profit little, unleſs joyned with remiſſion of ſins. For Chriſt firſt found us Enemies to God, and the Corruptions, which make the diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us, do always ſtick to us, ſo that he might juſtly be diſpleaſed with us rather than favourable to us. But Juſtification conſiſts in this, if God impute not our ſins to us. Therefore this latter Grace ought never to be ſeparated from the former. Yea, the Goſpel will be lame and corrupt, unleſs it conſiſt of theſe two Members: That is; unleſs men be taught that they are reconciled to God by Chriſt, by the free imputation of his Righteouſneſs, and by the new birth of the Spirit, transformed to newneſs of life.

The Apoſtles alone for integrity, and innocency of life were worth credit: but leſt the ſtubborneſs of men
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:192139:84"/>might have any pretext to cloak their unbelief, God would add to this teſtimony another greater, to wit, the teſtimony of his Spirit. This very teſtimony of the Spirit, is joyned elſewhere with the teſtimony of the, Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">John 15.26 27.

                     </note> and</hi> Maimonides <hi>attributes a fact to</hi> Gamaliel <hi>far different (as it ſeems) from this advice; for he ſaith that when he ſaw Hereticks ſo abound in his days (meaning Chriſtians, there being none other at that time among the Jews that might be ſuppoſed to have been ſo called) he compoſed a form of Prayer, in which God was requeſted to extirpate the Hereticks, which form he put with the other forms of Prayer in the Jewiſh Liturgy then uſed, that it might be ready in every ones mouth. If this fact be true, it ſeems to argue ſuch an inraged ſpirit againſt the Chriſtians, and hatred at the Chriſtian Religion, to have been in this man, as ſuits not well with this advice of his, which</hi> Luke <hi>gives here an account of: Except that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:192139:85"/>one would think to reconcile</hi> Maimonides <hi>and</hi> Luke, <hi>by ſaying, this was</hi> Gamaliels <hi>mind and judgment, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apoſtles, and their followers were Hereticks, and even dangerous, yet they were not to be ſuppreſſed by human violence, or the Counſels of Human Policy, but the whole of it ſhould be committed to the wiſe Providence of God, that their rooting out muſt be lookt for from God, and not haſtened by Human Contrivances, and therefore that for this purpoſe he compoſed that Prayer, and added it to the reſt in the daily Liturgy, whereby God was beſought to root out theſe Men, if they were ungodly, and Hereticks, that if they were not from God, he himſelf would in a way, and manner moſt agreeable to his own Providence, and Wiſdom diſappoint, and overturn their deſigns.

We cannot meet this objection any other way, unleſs we ſay that</hi> Joſephus <hi>was mistaken for making</hi> Theudas <hi>his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition later then he ought. For, that there were two</hi> Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſes, <hi>who feigned themſelves Prophets, one after another, stirring up the Jews to hope for new things, I can no ways be perſwaded. Let</hi> Luke <hi>and</hi> Joſephus <hi>be compared, where both of them ſpeak of</hi> Theudas, <hi>and it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they both meant one and the ſame man. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all circumstances agree ſo exactly in both Narratives, that</hi> Joſephus <hi>ſeems to have Commented upon</hi> Luke. <hi>One difference there is as to the time, which yet is not of ſuch moment, that we ſhould invent two</hi> Theudaſes: <hi>For if as often as we meet with ſuch differences in the Narratives of Antient Writers, we would distinguiſh Perſons, and things, we must beware, lest unadviſedly we make two men of one.

                  <q>Admit only that <hi>Joſephus</hi> errs in computing the times,

Whence it appears, that the Taxing, and Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Judas</hi> the Galilean, could not fall out till after <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Baniſhment.</q> Thus far <hi>Valeſius</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Euſcbius</hi> his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, Book 1. Chap. 5. The ſame <hi>Valeſius,</hi> in the ſame place a little before: <q>
                     <hi>Joſephus, ſaith he,</hi> does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mention the Taxing made by <hi>Quirinius</hi> in <hi>Syriae</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Archelaus</hi> was baniſhed. But he ſpeaks not of this Taxing, which <hi>Luke</hi> in his Goſpel ſays,

For this man, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth, was Governor about the latter end of <hi>Herods</hi> Reign. <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo writeth, that <hi>Judea</hi> was Taxed by <hi>Sentius Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus.</hi> Whence it appears,

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Marcion c.</hi> 19.</note> that in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> times, ſome have read in <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel, <hi>Saturninus</hi> for <hi>Quirinius.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is ſtrange that <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhould have preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the firſt Taxing, who yet was ſo accurate in proſecuting the Hiſtory of his Nation, that he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons all the Governors of <hi>Syria;</hi> for he mentioneth both <hi>Sentius Saturninus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi> his Succeſſor. When <hi>Euſebius</hi> underſtood this, it was his Judgment that it was the ſame Taxing that <hi>Luke</hi> &amp; <hi>Joſephus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but that <hi>Joſephus</hi> was miſtaken, who thought this Taxing to have happened after <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Baniſhment.
<note place="margin">In Chronico.</note> Therefore the ſame <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> placeth that Tumult of <hi>Judas</hi> the Galilean, which followed upon the Taxing made by <hi>Quirinius,</hi> about the time of Chriſts Birth, and the end of <hi>Herods</hi> Reign.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:192139:89"/>Hiſtorian, when he mentions <hi>Quirinius</hi> his coming to <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> ſaith not that ever he came to <hi>Syria</hi> before, or that any Taxing was before that time made either by him, or any other <hi>Roman</hi> Judge. But if the Taxing had been made already, why is it done again by the ſame man; for if it had been rightly made, and without Fraud, it was no ways neceſſary it ſhould be done again; but if not well, juſtly it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to ſend another who ſhould make a more juſt Taxing. Further, how could that former Taxing be made by a <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate, while <hi>Herod</hi> Reigned, ſeeing that the Senate had declared <hi>Herod</hi> to be King of <hi>Judea</hi> by an undoubted Right; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate a right to Act any thing by Authority in <hi>Judea,</hi> ſo long as King <hi>Herod</hi> lived: I paſs by that in the laſt days of <hi>Herod,</hi> wherein Chriſt was born, <hi>Saturninus,</hi> and <hi>Varus,</hi> but not <hi>Quirinius</hi> were <hi>Caeſars</hi> Deputies in <hi>Syria.</hi> Theſe be the Arguments whereby I am chiefly inclined to think <hi>Scaligers</hi> Opinion not probable, who argues for two Taxings. Neither doth it withſtand that <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith that the Taxing which was made a little before Chriſt was born, was the firſt; for by it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant that this was the firſt time wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> Taxed <hi>Judea,</hi> neither was there ever any Taxing before. It is alſo falſe what <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, that the latter Taxing belonged to <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Tetrarchy,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>infine</hi> 17. <hi>Ant. &amp; init.</hi> 18.</note> and was for his Goods only. Yea, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith expreſly that <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinius</hi> was ſent by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to Tax through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Judea. Petavius</hi> followed <hi>Scaligers</hi> Opinion, to which he adds this only, that both theſe Taxings were made by <hi>Quirinius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">in Rat. temp.</note> being ſent with an extraordinary Power to <hi>Syria.</hi> But both <hi>Luke,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> their words refel this, for <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, When <hi>Cirenus</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Syria;</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath: To do Juſtice
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:192139:89"/>among the People; which cannot be ſaid but of the ordinary Governor. <hi>Caſaubon</hi> in his Exercitations, takes the ſame courſe to reconcile <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> But indeed in my Judgment all of them have loſt their Labour, for one of them muſt needs be in a miſtake, which ſince it is heinous to ſay of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt, it is ſafer to lay the cauſe of the miſtake upon the Jewiſh Writer. Which, if it ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh to any, there remains yet this one way of reconciling them, which we mentioned already, that in <hi>Lukes</hi> Text we reſtore <hi>Saturninus</hi> inſtead of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinius,</hi> and that we ſay the Taxing in his time was made, not by the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, but by King <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf. It might alſo be ſaid that this Taxing was indeed finiſh't, and perfected, when <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinius</hi> was Governor after <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Baniſhment; yet it begun long before towards the end of <hi>Herods</hi> Reign, at which time Chriſt was born. Thus alſo the difference that appears between <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> is taken away. By this means <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> agree excellently well together, for the Evangeliſt calls that Taxing, which began to be made about the time of Chriſts Birth, <hi>Herod</hi> being yet alive, the Taxing of the Governor <hi>Quirinius,</hi> becauſe it ended at length under <hi>Quirinius.</hi> This indeed in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the fitteſt interpretation of that Goſpel Text in <hi>Luke,</hi> being ſuch as ſuppoſeth only one Taxing to have been made, not two, as <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and others following his Opinion, contrary to the faith of Hiſtory have deviſed.</q> Thus far the Learned <hi>Valeſius.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Gamaliel</hi> drew a perverſe conſequence from true Principles, becauſe that which only ſhould be applyed to Faith, he does miſapply to outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and way of acting.

                  <hi>Caſtellio</hi> in his <hi>Vatican</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Calvin</hi> thus: <q>Seeing the buſineſs was about a matter of Religion, which was yet then in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and not about any Crime expreſly forbidden by the Law, <hi>Gamaliel</hi> could not, though he had been a Chriſtian, have given the Jews a better advice. Firſt, his reaſon was true, if it was not from God, it would fall of it ſelf, according to that of Chriſt, <hi>Every Plant which my Heavenly Father hath not Planted,
<note place="margin">Matt. 13.15.</note> ſhall be plucked up: Let them alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.</note> &amp;c. And of <hi>David, who would not kill,</hi> Saul <hi>when he might.</hi> Alſo the Examples which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> produceth, are true. Now whereas <hi>Gamaliel</hi> feared that they ſhould fight againſt God, that came afterward to paſs; which,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:192139:90"/>if they had followed his advice, had never been. <hi>And a little after,</hi> Whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith that this advice of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> is ſuch as would overthrow all Political Order, and enervate Church-Diſcipline, he ſaith not true; for the Diſcipline of the Apoſtles was not quite without Nerves, though it had no ſuch Nerves as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks. Alſo Political Order is in force in ſins that are certain, and without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. In the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> the LXX Elders judged in ſmaller, and more eaſy Cauſes, and brought the more hard and difficult to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God concerning them. So may it alſo be done now. Adultery, Manſlaughter, falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and other certain, and known Crimes, may without hazard be judged: But for Hereticks, the matter is controverted (for if it were not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, it would not be debated any more then Murder) and therefore are to be referred to the Oracle. Therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> waited the time of the Oracle, and yet did not in the mean while over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Political Order, ſo we are to wait the time of Gods Judgment, which will be a certain Oracle in this Controverſy. Yet God in the mean time will make uſe of the ſervice of his Miniſters in things not controverted.</q> Theſe are <hi>Caſtellio</hi>'s words, with which agree theſe choice words of the Sermon Preached before the Houſe of Lords on <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1680. <hi>Of Societies of Men, Chriſtians of all others are moſt averſe from ways of violence and blood, eſpecially from uſing any ſuch ways upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And among Chriſtian Churches, where they differ among themſelves, if either of them uſe theſe ways upon the account of Religion, they give a ſtrong preſumption againſt themſelves, that they are not truly Chriſtians.</hi> Thus far the Right Reverend Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph, William Lloyd,</hi> a Man of excellent Parts, great Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſingular Piety, and Benignity, to whom I do,

Thoſe Prayers being ended, they laid hands on them, in token of the Miniſtries being committed to them. Sometimes alſo the Holy Ghoſt did by the Prophets point out by name ſuch as he would have choſen to this or that Miniſtry.

                  <hi>Men Brethren and Fathers.</hi> If we may give credit to the famous <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> Stephen, <hi>Who was a Proſelyte, calls the Jews Brethren, as being partaker of the ſame Promiſes with them, an obſerver of the ſame Law, a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of the ſame God.

But ſeeing <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the Promiſe made by God to him, was called the Father of Nations; thoſe Nations, whoſe Father he was called by God, could be no other than thoſe which the Meſſias purchaſed to God the Father by his own Blood.

For <hi>Moſes</hi> makes his account, wherein together with <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> only his poſterity, and thoſe that proceeded out of his Loins are comprehended, his Sons Wives being expreſly excepted, <hi>v.</hi> 26. For which reaſon, not only thoſe who actually entred <hi>Egypt</hi> with him, but alſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his two Sons, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> are comprehended in the number of ſeventy, although they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> long before; becauſe both as proceeding out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Loyns, and being as to their Original of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were ſtrangers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo were deſervedly reckoned, as if they had gone down into <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Jacob.</hi> And it is of ſingular moment in that Catalogue, that <hi>Judas</hi>'s two Grand-Children by <hi>Pharez,</hi> to wit, <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul,</hi> although they were not then born, as may be gathered from the ſeries of Time, but afterwards in <hi>Egypt,</hi> are comprehended in that number, <hi>v.</hi> 11. that they might ſupply the place of the two Sons of <hi>Juda, Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. For which reaſon alſo, <hi>Num.</hi> 26.21. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the reſt of the Tribes, not the Grand-children,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:192139:106"/>but only the Children make up the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Families, in the Tribe of <hi>Juda</hi> alone, not only his Sons, <hi>Selah, Pharez,</hi> and <hi>Zera,</hi> but alſo his Grand-children <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul,</hi> are made Princes of the Families of Judah, as if added to his Sons. But none of theſe things have place in <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> Diſcourſe; for he does not give a Genealogy of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Race, but only gives an account, who they were that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent for from the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> His words are, <hi>Then ſent</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and called his Father</hi> Jacob <hi>unto him, and all his kindred, threeſcore and fifteen Souls.</hi> He ſent for more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Loyns, but did not ſend for all that came out of his Loyns. Firſt therefore, <hi>Juda</hi>'s two Grand-children are to be excluded there, then <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf with his two Sons; for he could not ſend for thoſe, as not yet born, nor himſelf and his Sons, as already dwelling in <hi>Egypt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we ſubſtract theſe five, and then <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, who is mentioned apart by <hi>Stephen,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of <hi>Moſes</hi> number of 70. but 64 to wit, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Brethren, one Siſter <hi>Dina,</hi> and 52 Sons of the Brethren, to which, if we add the eleven Wives of of the eleven Brethren, which undoubtedly <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent for together with their Husbands, and which belonged to the Kindred, ye have his whole Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred 75 Souls. The Ethiopick renders it, <hi>And</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>after that he knew that, he commanded that they ſhould call his Father, and all his Kindred. And there came unto him</hi> 75 <hi>Souls.</hi> Which verſion excludes <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and his Children, becauſe they could not be ſaid to come unto him; but in that he errs, that he includes <hi>Jacob</hi> alſo in the number of the 75 Souls, as coming alſo with the reſt to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> For that number agreeth only to his Kindred. Nor does it militate any thing againſt what is ſaid, that moſt are of Opinion that the ten Sons of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:192139:107"/>are comprehended by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the number of the 52 Grand-children of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 46.21. were at that time either none or few of them born, and therefore they could not be rightly ſaid to have been ſent for by <hi>Joſeph.</hi> For it may be anſwered, that his Sons, though born afterwards, might be rightly added to the number, leſt he only among all the Brethren ſhould be reckoned without Children. But there is no neceſſity to recur to that, ſeeing he was of that age then that he might have had ſo many Children. For <hi>Joſeph</hi> was thirty years of age when he was firſt brought before <hi>Pharoah, Gen.</hi> 41.46. Betwixt which time and <hi>Jacobs</hi> entrance into <hi>Egypt</hi> interceded ſeven years of Plenty, and two of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.6. Now when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was 39 years of age, <hi>Benjamin</hi> might be of the age of 37. at which age, eſpecially where <hi>Polygamy</hi> had obtained, why might not he be Father of ten Sons? Hence it may be collected, that neither is there any error to be imputed to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text from <hi>Stephens</hi> words, nor to <hi>Stephens</hi> words from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text, but that both ſpoke very well according to their different intent. Hence it alſo follows, that the Text of the Seventy Interpreters is corrupted, which <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.27. inſtead of Seventy has Seventy five. Which ſeems cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to have been done by ſome Chriſtians, who when they could not reconcile the place of <hi>Stephen</hi> with the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and did believe that by all means <hi>Stephen</hi> was to be credited, they altered the Greek Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> or rather corrupted it, that it might be at leaſt demonſtrated whence <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> had theſe things. There are manifeſt ſigns of Corruption. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> All the Hebrew Copies, <hi>Joſephus Antiq.</hi> 4. and the ancient Latin Interpreter read only 70. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Seventy Interpreters themſelves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.32. where this ſtory is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do agree with the Hebrew, and number on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:192139:107"/>70. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they might varniſh the 27th. Verſe we have mentioned, with the more likeneſs of Truth, they have corrupted alſo the 20th. Verſe, where contrary to the Faith of all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Copies, and the Samaritan, and Ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, they have added five others of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to wit, <hi>Machir</hi> the Son of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine <hi>Syra,</hi> and <hi>Galaad Machirs</hi> Son, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> Grandſon: As alſo <hi>Ephraims</hi> two Sons, <hi>Sutalaam</hi> and <hi>Taam,</hi> and <hi>Edem</hi> one Son of <hi>Sutalaam Ephraims</hi> Grandſon. But inſtead of <hi>Taam, Auguſtin,</hi> 16 <hi>Civ. Dei.</hi> 40. has <hi>Bareth,</hi> from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. in which Chapter it is alſo to be obſerv'd, that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention made of <hi>Taam</hi> nor <hi>Edem,</hi> and that the Sons of <hi>Manaſſes, Machir,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> were recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more than five. Wherefore did they then pitch upon only five of them to put into <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue? Becauſe they who would ſupply <hi>Stephens</hi> number in <hi>Moſes</hi> did not ſtand in need of more. But the ſame Perſons, not very conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>v.</hi> 27. added to <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> with their five Sons and Grandſons two others although without their names. For inſtead of that which is in <hi>Moſes, And the Sons of</hi> Joſeph <hi>who were born in</hi> Egypt <hi>were two Souls,</hi> the Seventy have <hi>Nine Souls.</hi> Whence at laſt was the number of the 57 Souls to be collected; ſo that all things in that Verſe are moſt corrupt, and worthy of no credit. Nor can any greater abſurdity be imputed to <hi>Stephen,</hi> then that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent for not only himſelf, and his two Sons preſent with him, but alſo his three Grandſons, and two of their Sons, who were born long after.</q>

                  <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob. When God is ſaid to be the God of any, it is to be underſtood a ſpecial Favourer, and Bountiful Patron of him, as ſufficiently appears from that form of the Covenant, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12. <hi>I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> cites, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and from the peculiar Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8. Now they had ſome good things meaſured out unto them in this life, but mixed with many troubles. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they any ſettled place of their own, but wandred up and down with their Families and Flocks, and were alſo frequently toſſed with the Injuries of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:192139:115"/>Men and Fortune. Hence alſo <hi>Jacob</hi> called himſelf a Stranger and Pilgrim, when he ſpoke to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> which the Author to the Hebrews very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently inſiſteth on, <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 13. It remains therefore that God was the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> not only when they lived on Earth, but alſo when God ſpoke theſe things to <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, as I ſaid, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had befallen them in this Life which could anſwer the magnificence of ſo great a name. But beſides we much more do good to him, if we can, for whoſe ſake we do good to others. God wants not power, and he ſays that he will bleſs their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity for the ſake of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> much more therefore, will he do good to them. But they who are dead are not capable of a Benefit, if they are always to continue in the ſtate of death. It follows therefore, that they are to be reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life, as Chriſt from hence evinced againſt the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.38. that he may in a peculiar and ſpecial manner be the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to them. Moreover <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> as we have obſerved on the forecited place of <hi>Matthew</hi> do not ſignify the Soul, which is only a part of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the Perſon conſiſting both of Soul and Body, to which Life and Death are properly attributed. But ſeeing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God are no leſs certain than things that are now in being, in Gods account, who is both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and powerful to raiſe them from the Dead, they are reckoned as riſen already according to that <hi>Luke,</hi> 20.38. <hi>For all live to him. Origen,</hi> Book 4. againſt <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> ſaith that the names of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> joyned with the name of God, had ſo great Virtue, <hi>that not only were they intermixed by their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with their holy Frayers,</hi> and the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> called upon in driving away evil

Whence it follows that his true Worſhip does not conſiſt in Ceremonies. For he deſires none of thoſe things which we offer to him on their own account, but only that he may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe us in the ſtudy of Godlineſs.

Whatſoever Worſhip is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in Spirit, is unſavoury in Gods account. Therefore let us know that God ſeeketh us, not our Poſſeſſions, which we obtain from him only at his pleaſure, by his Free-Grace.

For we know what a Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Judges he had. Wherefore it is no wonder if they forced him to hold his Peace, with their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous noiſe, and mad Out-cries. And we alſo
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:192139:126"/>ſee that of purpoſe he uſed long Circumlocutions, that he might lenify them as wild Beaſts. But it's very probable that their Rage was ſtirred up when he ſhewed them that they had grievouſly corrupted the Law, that their Temple was polluted with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, &amp; that there was nothing that remained pure among them: by reaſon that they reſting in bare Types, did not Worſhip God Spiritually; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not refer their Ceremonies to the Heavenly Type. But although <hi>Stephen</hi> did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go about to vindicate himſelf, but did endeavour by degrees to ſoften their fierce Spirits; yet he ſpoke very pertinently to purge himſelf of the Crime they Impeached him for. Theſe were the two principal Heads of his Accuſation; That he had ſpoke Blaſphemy againſt God and his Temple; That he had endeavoured to abrogate the Law: <hi>Stephen,</hi> that he might diſſolve theſe Calumnies, beginning his diſcourſe from the calling of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſheweth that the Jews had no advantage of the Gentiles by nature, by proper right, or by Merits for their works; but only by free gift, to wit, becauſe God had adopted them in the Perſon of <hi>Abraham.</hi> It makes likewiſe very much for him, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Salvation was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> before there was a Temple, Ceremonies, or Circumciſion itſelf. Which things the Jews ſo much gloried in, that they thought there could be no true Worſhip performed to God, no Holineſs without them. He afterwards declared how wonderful, and manifold the goodneſs of God had been towards <hi>Abrahams</hi> Race, and on the other hand how wickedly, and perverſely they had rejected the Grace of God, as much as lay in them. Whence it plainly appears that it cannot be aſcribed to their Merits that they are reckoned the People of God, but only becauſe God of his own good pleaſure choſe an unworthy
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:192139:127"/>People to himſelf, and did not ceaſe to do good to them, though ungrateful. By this means their high and proud Spirits might have been ſubdued, and reduced to humility, that being ſtripped of their fooliſh pride they were puffed up with, they might come to the Mediator. Thirdly, He ſhewed that an Angel was <hi>Praeſes</hi> in giving out the Law, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo diſcharge his Office, that he ſaid, other Prophets ſhould ariſe after him: yet of whom of neceſſity there was to be ſome Chief and Prince, who ſhould put an end to all their Propheſies and Praedictions, and bring them to a full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whence it is collected that they were not at all <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſciples, who did reject that Doctrine that was promiſed, and held forth in the Law, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its Author. Finally he ſhews that all the old Worſhip which was preſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not to be accounted of for itſelf, but ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be referred to another end, becauſe it was made with reſpect to a Heavenly Archetype: But that the Jews were corrupt Interpreters of the Law, in that they took every thing in a Carnal, and Earthly ſenſe. Hence it is evinced that there was no wrong done to the Temple or Law, becauſe Chriſt is brought in as the End and Verity of both. But ſeeing the ſtate of the cauſe did eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this point; that the Worſhip of God did not properly conſiſt in Sacrifices, and outward things, and that all Rites did nothing elſe but ſhadow out Chriſt, it was <hi>Stephens</hi> purpoſe to inſiſt chiefly on this point, if the Jews would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it: but when he came to the main point, they were highly enraged, and would not give au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience any further; he could not make application of what was ſpoken, and inſtead of an Epilogue, he was forced to conclude with a bitter rebuke.</q>

               <p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>They took care,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould have ſaid, The devout Men took care of <hi>Stephens</hi> burial toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did witneſſs both by words, and great ſtore of tears, how grievouſly, and bitterly they took his death, who did in no ways deſerve it at their hand. Which, notwithſtanding it is not once to be doubted, but that they did do it moderately enough, ſeeing they were well acquainted with the Precepts of Chriſt, which among other things alſo did forbid immoderate grief. See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> returneth again to deſcribe the Perſecution of the Faithful of the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, In ſo great outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the bloody Jews againſt the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Saul</hi> did more waſte it then the reſt; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received power from the Sanhedrin, not only when the Saints were put to death by him, did he give his voice againſt them, but alſo he entring into every houſe, and hailing thence both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, did bind them, and commit them into Priſon, and did beat them often thorow all Synagogues: and ſo for fear he forced ſome to blaſpheme by denying Chriſt, he perſecuted others, conſtant in the Faith, to death. So cruel and furious is the vehemency of the Zeal which is not according to knowledge.

                  <hi>He joined himſelf to</hi> Philip. That is, He departed not from <hi>Philips</hi> ſide, and gave heed both continually and daily to his Preaching.</p>

By the way, hence we may ſee, that <hi>Peter</hi> was not a Monarch of the Apoſtolical Colledge, and of the whole Church, for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour uſes not to be greater, and higher then he that ſends him. I do reckon the Pope will not ſuffer himſelf to be ſent in Embaſſy any where by his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and fellow Biſhops.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:192139:136"/>the power of God, and Chriſt; for otherwiſe there was no need of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> Prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they might receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> That is, thoſe excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit, with which every where then they who believed in Chriſt, &amp; not only they who were to preach the Goſpel, and govern the Church, were wonderfully gifted: that having obtained the gift of Propheſying, and ſpeaking with divers Tongues, they might confirm the Doctrine of Chriſt, which then was new.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:192139:136"/>upon others, at the prayers of the Prophets, of which prayers impoſition of hands was a Symbol.

                  <hi>For thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> Many who are not of a right heart in the ſight of God, oftentimes excel in gifts of the Spirit, for neither did the perverſeneſs, and hypocriſy of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor, hinder him to excel in the gifts of the Spirit: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the gifts of the Spirit been ſo corrupted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. if their hearts had been ſincere, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all wickedneſs. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore doth not give the cauſe why <hi>Simon</hi> could not partake of the gifts of the Spirit, as thoſe do ſuppoſe, who do think by the name of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to be ſignifyed by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm, the gifts of the Holy Spirit; but why he could not obtain eternal life, promiſed in the Goſpel, Preached by the Apoſtles, becauſe truly God is the ſearcher of hearts, who doth not ſave any, except the upright in heart; he ſeeth his heart to be wicked and perverſe, and by crooked windings, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings, to have turned from the ſincerity of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

He told him that that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus who was born of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> born of a Virgin at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and ſuffered a bitter death for our Offences, was raiſed from the dead, to ſit at the right Hand of God the Father, whoſe only begotten Son he is, and that none is to obtain eternal Salvation, but thoſe who earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of their ſinful condition, believe in Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; obey his precepts. And that thoſe that do profeſs his Faith and Repentance, ought to be dipt into the Water, according to Chriſts appointment, that the remiſſion of ſins may be ſealed unto them by this holy dipping, which remiſſion is freely granted to every repenting ſinner, when he does believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="36">36. <hi>And as they went on their way.</hi> That is, while they went forward in the Eunuchs Journey to <hi>Gaza</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>They came unto a certain water. Euſebius</hi> in his Book of Hebrew places, which <hi>Hierom</hi> did tranſlate
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:192139:145"/>and augment, ſaith, <hi>Bethſur in the Tribe of</hi> Juda, <hi>or</hi> Benjamin, <hi>and at this day is called</hi> Bethſoron, <hi>a Village to us in the twentieth mile, as we Travel from</hi> Aelia <hi>to</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>near which there is a Fountain that ſpringeth at the foot of the Hill, &amp; is ſuckt up by the ſame ground in which it ariſeth. And the</hi> Acts of the Apoſtles <hi>do tell us that the Eunuch of</hi> Candace <hi>the Queen was Baptized in this Fountain by</hi> Philip. <hi>And there is alſo another Village called</hi> Bethſur, <hi>in the Tribe of</hi> Juda, <hi>diſtant a thouſand paces from</hi> Eleutheropolis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See here is Water,</hi> &amp;c. It doth manifeſtly appear that the Eunuch among other things was taught by <hi>Philip,</hi> that Baptiſm of Water was of neceſſity to be taken by them, who repenting of their ſinful life, do imbrace the Faith of Chriſt, as a Holy Rite appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and commanded by Chriſt himſelf, that it might be in itſelf a figure of new life, and a ſeal of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins obtained through Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="37">37. <hi>If thou believeſt.</hi> That the Eunuch is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be Baptized, unleſs he had profeſſed a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith in Chriſt, it doth ſufficiently enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how truly great <hi>Baſil</hi> hath ſpoken in his Book on the Holy Spirit, <hi>ch.</hi> 12. <hi>Faith and Baptiſm are the two means of Salvation, inſeparably cleaving together; for Faith is perfected by Baptiſm, but Baptiſm is founded by Faith, and by the ſame names both things are fulfilled. For as we believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: ſo alſo we are Baptized in the name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy Spirit: &amp; indeed there goeth before a Confeſſion leading us unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but Baptiſm followeth, ſealing our Confeſſion &amp; Covenant.</hi> But the Covenant of God is his promiſe of giving us eternal life, and our anſwer is our promiſe of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God according to his will revealed to us. The ſame Churches Teacher in his third Book againſt <hi>Eunomius: Baptiſm is the ſeal of Faith, Faith is the confeſſion of the God-head: it is neceſſary we ſhould firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, then be ſealed with Baptiſm.</hi> According to this Rule of Scripture, and agreeing with reaſon itſelf,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:192139:145"/>the moſt part of the Greeks in all Ages, even unto this day, retain a Cuſtom of delaying Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, till they themſelves can give a Confeſſion of their Faith, as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath noted on <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 13. But eſpecially the ſixth Canon of the Synod of <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſarea</hi> is to be obſerved, whoſe words are as follows: <hi>Concerning a Woman with Child, that ſhe may be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed when ſhe pleaſes; for her Baptiſm concerns not her Child. For every one is to give a demonſtration of his own choice in a Confeſſion.</hi> For however the Interpreters draw it to another purpoſe, it does appear that the queſtion was made of Women big with Child, becauſe it did ſeem that the Child was Baptized to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Mother, which, notwithſtanding, ought not, nor uſed not to be Baptized, except of its own proper Election and Profeſſion. And to this purpoſe are the words of <hi>Balſamo:
<note place="margin">In Compen. can. tit. 4.</note> The unborn Babe cannot be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; becauſe it is not come into light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it have a choice of making Confeſſion, which is required in Holy Baptiſm. And</hi> Zonaras, <hi>The Babe will then need Baptiſm, when it can chuſe.</hi> But the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod doth determine that Baptiſm of a Woman great with Child, doth therefore rightly proceed, becauſe her Baptiſm concerns her alone, who can Confeſs what ſhe believeth, and not the Child in her Womb. But that Synod of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> was held before the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod; For we read the name of <hi>Baſil</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Amaſia,</hi> ſubſcribed to the <hi>Neocaeſarean</hi> Synod, who ſuffered Martyrdom under <hi>Licinius,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes in his Chronicle. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his 40th Oration, which is upon Holy Baptiſm, treating of thoſe who die without Baptiſm, gives us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in thoſe to whom Baptiſm was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, <hi>by reaſon of Infancy.</hi> And the ſelf ſame <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> though he was a Biſhops Son, being a long time bred up under his Fathers care, was not Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:192139:146"/>till he came to Man's age, as he doth teach us in his life. In like manner <hi>Baſil</hi> the great, that was born of very devout Parents, and inſtructed unto Godlineſs from his Childhood, was not Baptized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he was a Man, if any Credit be to be given to his life, that goes about under the name of <hi>Amphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius. John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> called afterward <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> was born of Chriſtian Parents, as the truer opinion is, Tutored by the famous Biſhop <hi>Meletius,</hi> was yet not Baptized till he was one and twenty years of age. <hi>Hierom</hi> alſo, <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who were born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents, and conſecrated to Chriſtian Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, even from their Childhood, were not Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed before they were thirty years of age. Hence it doth manifeſtly appear, <hi>That the wiſeſt of our Fathers in Chriſt did not come unto Baptiſm, until they were come to a ſtrong and confirmed wit and age;</hi> as <hi>Jeremy Taylor,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> obſerveth in the 12th Sect. of the life of Chriſt, in the Sermon on Repentance, <hi>n.</hi> 20. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of Baptiſm, <hi>chap.</hi> 18. gives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Infants to come unto Chriſt to be inſtructed, not to be Baptized before they have underſtood the force of Baptiſm. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and diſpoſition, alſo age of every Perſon, the delaying of Baptiſm is more profitable: yet chiefly about little ones. What need is there of Sureties to be brought in danger, who even themſelves may break their promiſes through mortality, and be deceived by the increaſe of an evil diſpoſition? Indeed the Lord ſaith,</hi> Do not ye hinder them to come unto me. <hi>Let them come therefore while they grow to years, let them come while they learn, &amp; while they come, let them be taught. Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, when they are inabled to know Chriſt. Why doth innocent age haſten to the remiſſion of ſins? Men will deal more warily in worldly affairs, ſo that they who are not truſted with an Earthly Inheritance, are truſted with an Heavenly: let them know to ask for Salvation, that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:192139:146"/>thou mayeſt appear to have given it to him that deſireth. Ludovicus Vives</hi> affirms, <hi>None,

If all the Anabaptiſts reſted in that Opinion, neither condemned that cuſtom of wickedneſs, and ſacriledge, reaſon would be on their ſide, neither would they ſay any thing which ſhould not be founded on the common Principles of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. The Primitive Churches did not Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; the learned</hi> Grotius <hi>hath made plain, and proved that in his Notes on the Goſpel. That doth moſt plainly appear by the very Rite of Baptizing, uſed in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. For Baptiſm is to be asked, before the Perſon to be Baptized enter into the Church, which the Surety does in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants name; a clear and diſtinct Confeſſion of Faith is required, which the ſame Surety rehearſeth in the Infants Name; a renouncing of the World, its Pomps, the Fleſh and the Devil, is to be promiſed, which the Surety, or as they call it, the Godfather promiſeth for the Infant; Is not this a clear argument, that of old, the Perſons who
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:192139:147"/>were to be Baptized, asked themſelves Baptiſm in their own Name, of their own Choice, and profeſs their Faith, and were wont to renounce their former life, to conſecrate the remainder of their life in this preſent mortal fleſh to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? Curcellaeus</hi> ſays in his diſſertation of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, <hi>num.</hi> 56. that the cuſtom of Baptizing Infants, was brought in without the Commandment of Chriſt, <hi>and did not begin before the third Age after Chriſt was born, in the two former Ages no ſign of it doth appear.</hi> This Cuſtom being brought in, was much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in <hi>Africa,</hi> then in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other parts of the world, and with a certain greater opinion of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unto which they did fall, who did expound of Baptiſm, that of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp; as if it did alſo include Infants; whereas notwithſtanding our Lord Jeſus ſpeaketh unto thoſe that were come to age, only in the Perſon of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and doth declare how greatly they ſtand in need to be born again of the ſpirit of water; that is, of the Spirit purifying their Hearts. Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by this metaphor alludeth unto the Baptiſm of Water that was ſometime to be commanded by him, but did think only of the Baptiſm of Perſons grown to years of underſtanding, ſeeing he commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19. that thoſe that were to be Baptized, ſhould firſt be inſtructed in the Faith. <hi>For it cannot be that the Body receive the Sacrament of Baptiſm, except the Soul receive the verity of Faith before hand,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> hath obſerved on that place of <hi>Matthew.</hi> See what we have noted above, upon <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all thy heart.</hi> That is, With an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thy Heart, and an unfeigned Faith. <hi>The Scripture,</hi> ſays <hi>Calvin, oftentimes taketh the whole Heart, for the ſincere, and unfeigned Heart, unto which is oppoſed a double Heart. So there is no need that we ſhould imagine them to believe perfectly, who believe with their
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:192139:147"/>whole Heart, when there may be a weak and ſamll Faith in him, who notwithſtanding ſhall have an upright Heart, and free from diſſimulation. So it is fit to take that which</hi> David <hi>glorieth of, that he doth love the Lord with all his Heart.</hi> Philip <hi>truly did firſt Baptize the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>whom as yet he knew to be far diſtant from the mark. The Faith therefore of the whole Heart, is that, which having lively roots in the Heart, nevertheleſs endeavoureth to grow dayly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou mayeſt.</hi> Hence we may gather how abſurd their Opinion is, who think that by Baptiſm, Faith is produced in Infants new born, and deſtitute of the uſe of all reaſon. For if Baptiſm cannot do it in thoſe that are come to years, it can much leſs do it in Infants. Neither can it be ſaid, except very abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they do believe in Chriſt, or in his Goſpel, when there does not indeed appear even the leaſt ſhadow of Faith in them. They do not know their Parents by any token, and know not what difference there is betwixt their right, and left hand, how then are they able to underſtand the leaſt thing of the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, which are the objects of our Faith? They do not conſent unto any human thing; can they then aſſent unto Divine things? They do frame no reſolution in their mind as yet, can they then frame that reſolution of leading their lives according to the Goſpel? Neither is their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much ſounder, who do not aſcribe any act of Faith to Infants, but yet nevertheleſs attribute ſome ſeeds of Faith. For what is that Seed? In the Seed lyeth hid the whole ſtrength &amp; ſubſtance of the thing that is to ariſe from thence. Is there any ſuch like thing in Infants? Does this vertue ſhew itſelf of its own accord in them, when they grow? No truly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be inſtructed in the Doctrine of the Goſpel. But,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> they ſay, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> therefore we muſt judge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Infants have Faith, or that they are damned
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:192139:148"/>Eternally, if they die in their Infancy.
<note place="margin">7 inſtitut. 8.</note> Famous <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> ſays, <hi>It is a fooliſh conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as if truly it did not appear, that this, at all the reſt of the precepts of the Goſpel, belongs to thoſe that are grown to years only, and are capable of inſtructions, either of Vertue, or of Vice, and that it doth oblige them alone. Truly Faith is not more neceſſary unto Salvation, than the obſervation of the reſt of the precepts of the Goſpel, and to live after the Spirit, not after the Fleſh. Since then Infants can be ſaved without theſe, why not alſo without Faith?</hi> The holy Scriptures do ſhew, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 18. that <hi>Davids</hi> little Son, begotten of <hi>Bethſheba</hi> by Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, died the ſeventh day after his birth. <hi>David</hi> did not mourn for him being dead without Circumciſion, who mourned for him before he died. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſays in his Funeral Sermon on the death of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, He did weep that he might not be taken from him: but left off to weep after he was taken away, whom he knew to be with Chriſt. And that ye may know that to be true which I aſſert, he did weep for</hi> Amnon <hi>his inceſtuous Son, that was murdered, be mourned for</hi> Abſalom <hi>the parricide, when he was ſlain: he did not think it needful to mourn for his innocent Son; becauſe he knew that they died for their wickedneſs, he did believe that this ſhould live for his innocency.</hi> This proof of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> doth ſhew that that was no ſpecial priviledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>David</hi> concerning that Infant; but that <hi>David</hi> did take that ground of conſolation from the common Law, which doth comprehend all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, at leaſt of Believers dying in their Infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I believe that Jeſus Christ is the Son of God.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, I unfeignedly believe from my Soul and Heart that Jeſus Chriſt is the only begotten Son of the Eternal God, the Redeemer, and Doctor of the world, promiſed in the Law and Prophets, who reconciled the Eternal Father to us by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his death, and ſwallowed up by the ſhining
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:192139:148"/>of his Goſpel, theſe ſparks which did gliſter in the Old Teſtament, that whoever ſhould hear him, and ſhould lead his life up unto the rule delivered by him, ſhould obtain Eternal Salvation by his Interceſſion and Merits. Hence it is manifeſt, <hi>That to be Baptized in the name, or unto the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is no other thing then to be Baptized upon profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, without Hypocriſy, and upon promiſe that he doth embrace the Doctrine revealed by him in the Scriptures, with an earneſt deſire of heart, and will reform and correct his manners according to it.</p>

And a few words afterwards: <hi>That therefore waſhing from ſins is attributed to Baptiſm, it is truly indeed attributed, but the ſignification is ſofter and ſlower then that it can expreſs Baptiſm, which is rather a ſign both of Death and Reſurrection.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:192139:149"/>Aſſembly therefore of all the Miniſters of the Word that was convened he did ask of a certain Miniſter</hi> John Fritz <hi>by name, who was ſometime Miniſter of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, <hi>how the Sacrament of Baptiſm was Adminiſtred at</hi> Lubec? <hi>Who for his Piety and Candor did anſwer grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Infants were Baptized naked at</hi> Lubec, <hi>after the ſame faſhion altogether as in</hi> Germany. <hi>But from whence and how that peculiar manner of Baptizing hath crept into</hi> Hamburg, <hi>he was ignorant.</hi> At length they did agree among themſelves that the Judgment of <hi>Luther,</hi> and of the Divines of <hi>Wittenburg</hi> ſhould be demanded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this point: which thing being done, <hi>Luther did write back to</hi> Hamburg, <hi>that this ſprinkling was an abuſe which they ought to remove. Thus plunging was reſtored at</hi> Hamburg.</p>
               <p>Common Fonts, big and large enough, were in Ancient times fitted and accommodated to dipping, in the which Fonts, by Conduits, or certain inferior paſſages, the water overflowing upon the Baptized, did run away, as is manifeſt even by this memorable Hiſtory of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7 Hiſt. Eccl. 17.</note> which we do here bring in. <hi>A certain Deceiver, a Jew by Nation, counterfeiting himſelf to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, was oftentimes Baptized, and by this ſort of Cheat had ſcraped together much money. When he had deceived many Chriſtian Sects by this Craft, for he had been Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed both by the</hi> Arrians <hi>and</hi> Macedonians: <hi>having none more whom he could deceive, at length he came to</hi> Paul <hi>Biſhop of the</hi> Novatians: <hi>and affirming that he had an earneſt deſire to be Baptized, he prayed the Biſhop that he would be pleaſed to Baptize him himſelf. He indeed praiſed the Jews will and deſire, but did deny that he could give him Baptiſm, before he had been inſtructed in the principles of Faith, and beſides all this, had faſted many days. But the Jew, who contrary to his wiſh or expectation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to faſt, did ſo much the more urge that he might be Baptized. The Biſhop therefore not willing to offend him
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:192139:150"/>with a longer delay, when he preſſed, and urged him to it, prepares the things that are neceſſary to Baptiſm. And when he had bought a white Garment to the Jew, and commanded the belly of the Font to be filled with water, he brought the Jew thither, as if he were going to Baptize him. But a certain ſecret vertue and power of God made the water ſuddenly to vaniſh. But when the Biſhop, and thoſe who were preſent, ſuſpecting nothing of what then was done, they did think that the water ran out by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret paſſage underneath, where it was wont to be let out, they fill the belly of it again, after they had carefully ſtopped all the paſſages. And when the Jew was brought again to the Font, the water did again altogether vaniſh. Then</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid, Either O Man thou deceiveſt, or has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowingly received the Sacrament of Baptiſm before. When therefore a great many men flocked together to ſee this Miracle, one that knew the Jew, found him to be the ſelf ſame man that was Baptized before by Biſhop</hi> Atticus. Hereto belongs alſo what the <hi>Maidenburg</hi> Centuriators do relate of <hi>Rathold.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8 Cent. 6.</note> 
                  <q>In the Year of the Lord, <hi>ſay they,</hi> 718. <hi>Rathold,</hi> General of the <hi>Friſians,</hi> was brought unto this by the Preaching of Biſhop <hi>Vulfran,</hi> that he was to be Baptized. When he had entred into the Font with one foot, drawing back the other foot, asked where the moſt part of his Anceſtors were? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Hell, or in Paradiſe? And hearing that more were in Hell, drawing back his foot that was in the Water, It is better, ſays he, that I follow the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part then the fewer. And being ſo deceived by the Devil, promiſing that he would give him three days hence matchleſs gifts, the ſelf ſame third day he periſhed with a ſudden and eternal death. <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus. Henry</hi> of <hi>Erford</hi> does relate the ſame out of the Acts and Monuments of <hi>Vulfran,</hi> chap. 26. <hi>Bergomenſis</hi> ſays that 'twas in the year 729.</q> Hither alſo pertaineth the Hiſtory of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who from
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:192139:150"/>hence got the Sirname of <hi>Copronymus,</hi> becauſe when he was Baptized in his Infancy, he defiled the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the holy Font with the Excrements of his Belly, in the Year of Chriſt 720. We have a like example in the Emperor <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, who was born at <hi>Norinburg</hi> the 28th of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year M.CCC.LXI. For he alſo is reported to have defiled the water with his Dung, when he was Baptized. Moreover it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that while the water that was to be applied to the Baptiſm of <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> was warming, the Paſtors houſe by Saint <hi>Sebald,</hi> was ſet on fire, and burned out. Which things certainly could not happen, if both the <hi>Copronymus</hi>'s, the one in the Weſt, and the other in the Eaſt, had been ſprinkled, and poured with a little water, being wrapped up in their ſwadling Bands and Clouts.

For he commanded very big Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheads to be digged a little deep into the Earth, ſo that the mouths of the Hogſheads did ſtand above ground unto the heighth of a mans knee, or leſs,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:192139:151"/>which being filled with water, it was eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into them. And he cauſed Curtains to be hanged about the Hogſheads upon ſmall Pillars ſet up, and Cords put into them, that each Hogſhead might be incloſed all about with a Vail in manner of a Circle: But a linnen Cloth did hang upon a Cord put through it, before the Prieſts, and his Fellow Miniſters, who ſtood on the one hand, to Adminiſter the Sacrament, that ſo all things being very modeſt on every ſide, there might not be any thing cenſured as folly or filthineſs in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt the honeſter ſort of Perſons ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves from the Sacrament of Baptiſm for ſhame ſake.</q> The Author proceeds, &amp; declareth the thing yet more clearly in this manner. <q>When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all did come to be Catechized, the Biſhop ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them all, commonly with a ſpeech that did agree to ſuch, &amp; ſetting one ſex over againſt another, on the right hand, &amp; on the left, anointed the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized with Oil: afterward biddeth them go from the Font. Therefore they coming unto the entrance of the Curtain, they one by one only did enter in with their Godfathers, and preſently the Godfathers did receive the Garment, with which the Perſon to be Baptized was clothed, and the Taper, when he went down into the water, and they holding it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their face, until they did reſtore it again to him, when he came out of the water. But the Prieſt, who did ſtand at the Hogſhead, when he had rather heard, then ſeen, that there was ſome body in the water; having removed the Vail a little, with thrice dipping of his head, did perfect what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and when he had anointed him with liquor of Chriſm on the Crown of the Head, and a white Garment being put on him, and when he had drawn back the Vail, he commanded the Perſon that was Baptized, to come out of the water, his Godfathers covering, &amp; putting
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:192139:151"/>on him the Garment which they did hold. Neither did the diligence of <hi>Otho</hi> in the Winter time, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to find out what was moſt convenient for the ſeaſon, to wit, he celebrated the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in warm Baths, and in hot water with the ſame neatneſs, and obſervation of Modeſty with the Hogſheads ſet into the Earth, and Curtains ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, Frankincenſe, and other odoriferous Species ſprinkling all things.</q> This moſt accurate diligence of Saint <hi>Otho</hi> proveth, that the prudence of thoſe Men was contrary unto all good order, who after a thouſand and three hundred years after Chriſt, did change Baptiſm, that is, dipping appointed by Chriſt into Rhantiſm, that is, ſprinkling brought into its place with great boldneſs, leſt thoſe that were to be Baptized in cold Countries and Seaſons, if they ſhould be plunged according unto Chriſts Commandment, might fall into diſeaſes, or be chilly with cold; for the heating of the water might be a ſufficient remedy againſt this evil, or danger, as the above quoted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Divine, and Reformer, <hi>John Bugenhagius</hi> in his aforementioned <hi>German</hi> Book, doth urge more at large. 'Anciently, (when Rhantiſm was not yet ſubſtituted to Baptiſm) <hi>ſays the Engliſh</hi> Chryſoſtom <hi>of this Age,</hi> 
                  <q>Thoſe who were Baptized, put off their Garments, which ſignified the putting off of the body of ſin; and were immerſed, and buried in the water, to repreſent the death of ſin; and then did riſe up again out of the water, to ſignify their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon a new life; and to theſe Cuſtoms the Apoſtle alludes <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Deſervedly therefore that moſt learned <hi>Anonymus</hi> Proteſtant of <hi>France,</hi> who anſwereth to that Tractate concerning the Communion under two kinds, of my Lord <hi>James Benigne Boſſuet,</hi> the famous Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. &amp; 25. <q>It is moſt certain that Baptiſm hath not been Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred hitherto, otherwiſe than by ſprinkling by the moſt part of Proteſtants, but truly this ſprinkling is an abuſe. This Cuſtom, which without an accurate examination, they have retained from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, in like manner as many other things, makes their Baptiſm very defective. It corrupteth its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and Ancient Uſe, and that nearneſs of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, which is needful ſhould be betwixt it and Faith, Repentance, and Regeneration. This reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>M. Boſſuet,</hi> deſerveth to be ſeriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to wit, that this Uſe of plunging hath continued for the ſpace of a whole thouſand and three hundred years, that hence we may underſtand that we did not carefully, as it was meet, examine things which we have retained from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and therefore ſince the moſt learned Biſhops of that Church do teach us now that the Cuſtom eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by moſt grave arguments, and ſo many Ages, was firſt aboliſhed by her, this ſelf ſame thing was
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:192139:152"/>very unjuſtly done by her, and that the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our duty doth require at our hands, that we ſeek again the Primitive Cuſtom of the Church, and the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</q> The ſame perſon there a little afterward: <q>Tho therefore we ſhould yield to <hi>M. Boſſuet,</hi> that we are convinced by the force of his arguments, that the nature and ſubſtance of Baptiſm conſiſteth in dipping, what may he hope for from us, but that we profeſs our ſelves obliged to him by no ſmall favour, and thank him that he hath delivered us from errour, when we greatly erred in this thing? And as we are reſolved indeed, to correct and rectify this error, ſo we deſire earneſtly with humble pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer and ſupplication of him, that he would correct and mend that error of taking away the Cup from the <hi>Laicks</hi> coming unto the Holy Supper. Does Monſieur <hi>Boſſuet</hi> think that the Proteſtants will have a greater reſpect of that Cuſtom which they have found not to be lawful, &amp; that by the moſt weighty, and ſolid arguments, than of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, and that to let <hi>Rome</hi> get an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of boldly, and freely breaking the Laws of Chriſt by the pernicious imitation of our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Far be that wicked frame of mind from them; they are ſtraiter bound by the Authority of their Holy Maſter, then to deſpiſe his voice, when his ſound cometh to their Ears. <hi>My Sheep follow my voice, and again I do know my ſheep.</hi> None, except Wolves lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king under a Sheep-skin refuſeth, and turneth from it.</q> So far our moſt learned <hi>Anonymus,</hi> which is moſt agreeable to his admonition unto the Papiſts barring the Lay-men from the Holy Cup, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his forecited anſwer to the Treatiſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> concerning the Communion under both kinds. <q>There is no place therefore for cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in theſe things, for thoſe that pretend the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Title of received cuſtom for the days practice,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:192139:153"/>when Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel is not the Cuſtom, but the Truth. <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> ſays the ſame Jeſus unto them, who did object unto him the worſt, and curſed Cuſtom of their Anceſtors. when we ſhall be preſented before the Judgment of Chriſt, he will not judge his Diſciples by Cuſtom, but by the lively, and effectual Word of his Goſpel. Neither ſhould any be taken with a vain hope of framing an excuſe from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, becauſe all the Authority of the Church is from Chriſt, granted unto her for that intent and purpoſe, that ſhe might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Religious Obedience to his Laws, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Precepts, but not that ſhe might break, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and cancel them.</q> Thus far the <hi>Anonymus</hi> our Countryman, whoſe ſound reaſoning hath made the Bookſellers generally ſuppoſe him to be <hi>Monſieur de la Roque,</hi> the moſt famous Paſtor of the Reformed Church which is at <hi>Rouan,</hi> whom his Writings do ſhew to be inferior to none in Godlineſs and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Heidegger</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtorico-Theological Anatomy</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> p. 2. upon the Canons of 21 <hi>Seſſion,</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is in the Church no more power of changing the Rites of the Sacraments appointed by Chriſt, than there is power of changing his Word and Law.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:192139:166"/>which they had taken before, neither did they interceed for the dead with their own words, but with her Works.</hi> Peter <hi>knew that what was thus asked, might be obtained; and that Christs aſſistance would not be wanting to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Widows, when he himſelf was clothed in the perſon of thoſe Widows. When therefore he prayed upon his knees, and this fit Advocate for the Poor and Widows, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God the Prayers addreſſed to him, having turned about to the Body that lay already waſhed upon a Table;</hi> Tabitha, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> riſe in the name of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Neither did he, who ſaid in his Goſpel, that he would give whatever was asked in his name, fail</hi> Peter, <hi>but brought preſent help. Death therefore is ſuſpended, and her ſpirit restored; and to the wonder, and astoniſhment of all, the revived body is restored to the light of the world; ſo powerful were the deſerts of Charity, ſuch was the efficacy of good works. She who gave ſupplies to the labouring Widows merited,</hi> that is, <hi>obtained, to be reſtored to life by the prayer of the Widows.</hi> The Ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies uſed to make woven Garments with their own hands, as <hi>Servius</hi> hath noted upon <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 74.

               <p n="40">40. <hi>But</hi> Peter <hi>put them all forth.</hi> That is, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to go forth, that being ſolitary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, he might pray with greater freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And kneeled down and prayed.</hi> That all the parts of him might be imployed in the Worſhip of God, and that the outward exerciſe of the Body, might help the weakneſs of the mind. <hi>It is our part,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin, as often as we kneel, that the inward ſubmiſſion of our Heart anſwer the Ceremony, that it may not be vain and deceitful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tabitha <hi>ariſe.</hi> This ſpeaking to the dead Body, doth more clearly hold out the power of God in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dead, then if in the third Perſon it ſhould be ſaid, Let this Body be enlivened, and revive again. Therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> holding out the deliverance of the

               <p n="42">42. <hi>Believed,</hi> &amp;c. Now the fruit of the Miracle appears manifold. For God comforted the poor, a pious Matron is reſtored unto the Church, in whoſe death there was a great loſs, and many are called to the Faith. For though <hi>Peter</hi> was the Miniſter of ſo great a miracle, yet he keeps not men to himſelf, but directs them to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="43">43. <hi>With one</hi> Simon <hi>a Tanner.</hi> It was a cuſtom even among the learnedſt of the Jews to learn ſome Trade, ſo that when it was requiſite, they might ſuſtain themſelves, and not burden others.

But as we cannot be Mens Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in ſuch things as concern Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo neither can we be the Servants of Angels; for the ſame reaſon which <hi>Paul</hi> adduces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price, be ye not the Servants of Men,</hi> militates againſt both theſe Services.

He who thus is the Servant of Chriſt, cannot in the ſame ſenſe be the Servant of Men; he is therefore bound by Chriſt for his Servant. So for the ſame reaſon he cannot be the Servant of Angels, who are our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Servants.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:192139:190"/>the Holy Ghoſt to Preach the Goſpel, and bring many to the obedience of the Faith. This work is peculiarly the work of the Holy Ghoſt, who is the Author, and uſeth to be called the worker of Faith, which yet is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. therefore the Holy Spirit is God, which worketh, and produceth that Faith in the Saints; and ſo the whole work of Regeneration, by the ſuper-abundant Riches of his Grace.</p>

Whereof a better ſenſe cannot be given then that: that one year was paſt ſince the ſubduing of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> began to Reign; and that he Reigned two years after free from the yoke of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> For in after-times <hi>Saul</hi> was by the <hi>Philiſtints</hi> ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of his Authority, and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by them with a heavy and long bondage. Which being at length removed, <hi>Saul</hi> is ſaid to have taken the Kingdom over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, to have again recovered it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.47. It is a proof that this oppreſſion laſted many years, that it having began eight years before <hi>David</hi> was born, yet before it was ended, <hi>Samuel</hi> named him to ſucceed in the Kingdom of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The Lord hath ſought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be a Captain over his People.</hi> For

How, I ſay, is he called a Youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his nine and twentieth year? Not to ſpeak of thoſe many Battels that are ſaid to have been fought againſt ſo many People, during <hi>Sauls</hi> Reign, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.46. and in them the various Conflicts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>David</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.25. Then afterward his flight, and his changing of his lurking places ſo often, becauſe of <hi>Sauls</hi> manifold Perſecutions: Laſtly, <hi>Davids</hi> dwelling among the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> one year and four months, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.7. compared with <hi>ch.</hi> 29.2. where <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſaith that <hi>David</hi> was with him theſe days, or theſe years, that is, ſome days, or ſome years, and other things are
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:192139:198"/>mentioned to have fallen out in <hi>Sauls</hi> Reign, all which do abundantly demonſtrate that there was more then two years ſpace betwixt <hi>Sauls</hi> Reign and <hi>Davids.</hi> And theſe things are thus far ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, as if that place in <hi>Samuel</hi> were eſteemed intire and incorrupt in the Editions which are now extant. But now indeed we muſt know that the Hebrew Copies ſhew this place to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, when betwixt the word <hi>Schanah</hi> and <hi>Ben,</hi> they leave a void place; for ſome of them have it thus written, <hi>Ben—ſchana Schaoul.</hi> It is probable the numerical note is wanting, which expreſſed the number of the years of <hi>Sauls</hi> Age, when he began to Reign: for it is uſual in theſe Books of Kings, to inſert the Ages of the Kings, and the time of their Reign, in the beginning of the Hiſtory of their Acts, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.10. where we read thus written: Iſhboſheth, Sauls <hi>Son, was fourty years old when he began to Reign over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and Reigned two years.</hi> Which ſame thing is done in <hi>David,</hi> and other Kings.

And in both theſe reſpects they are conſidered by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and the 10. As to the former reſpect, to feed on <hi>Idolothytes</hi> (or things offered to Idols) is a thing altogether midling or indifferent, provided it be done without adminiſtring Scandal to the weak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 24.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the latter regard it is a thing Evil, as being conjoyned with the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry, or which may at leaſt ſo be taken, by thoſe who know not our mind and ſo may give them a grievous occaſion of Scandal; And hereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain thoſe Texts. <hi>The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21.</note> they ſacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and not to God; but I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils; ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the Cap of Devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's Table
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192139:218"/>and of the Table of Devils.</hi> Where we may ſee that the Apoſtle, did not look upon it as an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Action, and lawful out of the Caſe of Scandal, to eat of theſe things in the Idols Temple, but as a moſt wicked thing, and for which there could be no good Plea. But you will ſay, what then is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Words, 1 Cor. 8. v. 9. and 11. <hi>But take heed leſt this Liberty of yours</hi> [of eating <hi>Idolothytes] become a ſtumbling block to the weak, &amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer, the Apoſtle ſo ſpeaks by way of Conceſſion, in reſpect of thoſe who boaſted of their Knowledge, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend an Action unworthy of Believers, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſitting down to meat with the Gentiles in the Idols Temple, with this vain pretext, That they knew that an Idol was nothing, and therefore by that which was nothing they could not be defiled; whoſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings the Apoſtle here meets with thus: Be it as you ſay, yet you ought to abſtain from thoſe Idol-feaſts, if it be but for the ſake of your weak Brethren, who perhaps do not ſo well as you underſtand that an Idol is nothing, and to them you may adminiſter a moſt dangerous ſtumbling-block or ſcandal; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in frequenting ſuch Feaſts, you ſin againſt your Brethren whom you caſt into peril of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; And alſo againſt Chriſt himſelf, who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd them with his Death. As for my own part, I am far otherwiſe minded, for I would abſtain for ever, not only from thoſe Sacrifices, but even from the eating of any ſort of Fleſh whatſoever, rather than offer any offence to my Brother. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore for a double cauſe would have Chriſtians refrain the Feaſts of Heathens kept in their Idol-Temples; Firſt, becauſe they were in themſelves evil, and none could be preſent thereat without Approbation, of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to joyn therein; And Secondly, becauſe by going thither they gave grievous offence to weak Brethren. But this laſt reaſon he preſſes chiefly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192139:219"/>the other unto Chapter the tenth, where ſo vehemently, (as we have ſeen) he thunders againſt thoſe Ethnick Banquets, charging ſuch as haunt them to be partakers of the Table and Cup of Devils. And the Apoſtle ſeems to have fallen into this Diſcourſe from an occaſion adminiſtred by the Corinthians themſelves, who had conſulted him by an Epiſtle touching certain matters, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning Meats offered to Idols;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.8. 1. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>
                     </note> And perhaps, how the Decree of the Apoſtles not long before made at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was to be underſtood. Here therefore the beſt Interpreter that could be wiſht of that Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whom we may learn how far the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things offered to Idols does extend, and what force it has to bind the Conſciences of faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. For there being divers kinds of <hi>Idolothytes,</hi> the Queſtion cannot be ſolv'd but by uſing a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Some <hi>Idolothytes</hi> there are from which we are to abſtain only for fear of, or to avoid the ſcandal that may thence happen to ariſe; ſuch are thoſe, which are commonly ſold in the Market, or which are ſet before us in the private Treats of our Friends. But there are other <hi>Idolothytes</hi> from which we muſt abſtain, becauſe it is ſimply and in it ſelf evil to eat thereof; As thoſe which are eaten in an Idol-Temple, which is always done with ſome either open or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite approbation of Idolatry. To this of the latter kind, as being of greater moment, the Apoſtles no doubt in their famous Council had chiefly an Eye. Yet ſometimes it may happen, that to eat even of thoſe <hi>Idolothytes</hi> which are ſet to ſale in the Market may not be without danger; As we are taught in the Hiſtory of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who out of his reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſire to propagate the Pagan Religion, or rather to vex the Chriſtians, caus'd all the Meat in the Shambles to be polluted with Sacrifices offered to his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192139:219"/>God's, that ſo the Chriſtians might be forced to feed on <hi>Idolothytes,</hi> unleſs they would ſtarve; Of which very thing we read in <hi>Theodoret</hi> thus. <hi>He</hi> (that is,

For all the Bread, Fleſh, Fruits, Herbs, and other Eatables, he cauſed to be ſprinkled with Holy-water; which when the Chriſtians ſaw, though they could not but grieve, lament, and heartily deteſt thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, yet they refuſed not to eat thereof in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Rule of the Apostle, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is ſold in the Shambles that eat,

Octavius</hi> preſently anſwers, <hi>That we contemn the Reliques of Sacrifices, and Idol-offered Cups, proceeds not from Fear, but is an Aſſertion of our true Liberty; For although every thing that is brought forth, as it is the inviolable Gift of God, cannot be corrupted by your

In which Queſtion, it doth not neceſſarily follow that the meat ſo found is offered to the Idol.

For he ſuppoſes no other man to be preſent, whom there might be danger to offend by doing it, and yet in ſuch a Caſe prefers rather out of Chriſtian Vertue to abſtain, than to do any thing unworthy of his Calling though for ſaving of his Life. The ſame did the Ancient Chriſtians that lived amongſt the Pagans always judge, ſo that many of them choſe rather
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192139:220"/>to die, than to pollute themſelves with any ſuch Food. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology on the eleventh of <hi>March</hi> is celebrated the Memory of Fourſcore Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in <hi>Campania</hi> who would not eat Fleſh ſacrificed, nor worſhip the Head of a Goat. And ſince Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from eating of Blood is by the Apoſtles in their Decree, placed in the ſame degree of neceſſity with the avoiding things offered to Idols, (of which it were not lawful for us to eat at this day, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed amongſt Idolaters) we may conclude the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer likewiſe ought not to be counted as only a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Law, and given to avoid the Scandal of the weak, but to be of perpetual duration even to the end of the World, and that although there were none that by its Violation could be offended.</q>

                  <q>All which Teſtimonies manifeſtly ſhew, That this particular, <hi>of things ſtrangled,</hi> was not anciently in moſt Copies of the New Teſtament, or was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the prohibition of Blood, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there is ſome ground to ſuſpect the ſame to have been falſified. For which there is this reaſon of no ſmall moment to be added; That the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192139:222"/>eating of things ſtrangled, or (which is tantamount) of that which dyeth of it ſelf, is by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> expresſly permitted to Strangers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.21. And yet even the Stranger was under pain of death prohibited to eat Blood, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, and 12. But it is not credible, that the Apoſtles, who ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly did remove all the reſt of the Burthens of the Moſaical Law peculiar to the Iſraelites, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles, would yet impoſe upon them any more heavy one, than what all <hi>Noah</hi>'s Poſterity were obliged unto. But this they would have done, if they added a prohibition of things ſtrangled, which belonged to the peculiar Diſcipline of the Iſraelites; As alſo did that accurate manner of killing Beaſts, and cleanſing them from their Blood, of which we read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 33, and 34.

So neither on the Sabbath-days, except on one only which was that before Eaſter. In the Canons of the Apoſtles (as they are called, which tho Learned Men know they deſerve not that Title, yet they muſt be confeſſed to be ancient) the 65th Canon runs thus: <hi>If any Clerk ſhall be found Faſting on the Holy Lords-day, or on the Sabbath, except one only, which next precedes the Paſchal Solemnity, on which Chriſt laid in the Sepulchre; let him be depoſed, (or degraded,) but if he be a Layman, let him be, with-drawn from (or Excommunicated.) Ignatius</hi> in an Epiſtle to the <hi>Phillipians</hi> goes higher. <hi>If any one ſhall Faſt on the Lords-day, or on the Sabbath-day, ſave only on the Sabbath before Eaſter, He is a Murtherer of Chriſt.</hi> And to omit for Brevity the reſt of the Teſtimonies of Antiquity, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his 4th Book againſt <hi>Marcion</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Sabbath-day from the beginning of the World had this Priviledge, to be free from Faſting.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> deny that the Patriarchs before <hi>Moſes</hi> did Sabbatize, it is to be underſtood not of their aſſembling together on that day, but of a ſtrict reſt during all the day. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians: Let us not Sabbatize after the manner of the Jews, enjoying Idleneſs. For he that Works not, let him not eat, and in the ſweat of thy Brows thou ſhalt eat thy Bread, ſay the ſacred Oracles. But let every one of you Sabbatize ſpiritually, applying your ſelves with Joy to Meditation on the Law of God, rather then to indulge the Body with reſt, admiring the Works of God, not Eating or Drinking ſuperfluouſly and walking Proudly, or pleaſing your ſelves with Dances and unreaſonable Frolicks. And after the Sabbath is over, let every Christian keep Holy the Lords-day.</hi> Origen Hom. 23. on Numbers. <q>It is neceſſary that every Holy and Righteous Man ſhould alſo obſerve the Feaſt of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192139:225"/>Sabbath.

On the Sabbath-day nothing ought to be done of all Worldly Works. Therefore if thou doſt forbear ſecular Imployments, and doſt nothing Worldly, but ſpendeſt the times in ſpiritual Exerciſes, coming to the Church, hearing the Divine Scriptures read and handled, Imploying thy thoughts on Heavenly things, careful of thy future Hope, and having the approaching Judgment before thine Eyes, ſhall have a regard not to things preſent and viſible, but to thoſe that are future and inviſible; This is the true obſervation of a Chriſtian Sabbath.</q> But on the Sabbaths in the Aſſemblies of the primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Holy Scriptures of the Old Teſtament were wont to be read to the People, even as amongſt the Jews. Which Cuſtom the Synod of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which was held about the year, 364. altered, eſtabliſhing that on the Sabbath-days, the New as well as Old Teſtament ſhould be read. <hi>Can.</hi> 16.</p>

For many that they may inlarge the Grace of the Spirit, deviſe I know not what Enthuſiaſms to themſelves that there may be no uſe for the external Word; But the Scripture allows not ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192139:240"/>which joyns the Miniſtry of men with the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit.

That the Word of man which otherwiſe would evaniſh in the Air might penetrate into the Soul endued with heavenly Light. Theſe fanatical men are therefore miſtaken, who under pretext of the Spirit caſt off external Doctrine. We therefore muſt obſerve the temperature made here by</hi> Luke, <hi>that we can profit nothing by the bare hearing of the Word without the Grace of the Spirit, and that the Spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us, not to beget contempt of the Word, but rather to inſtil the Faith of it in our Minds, and write it in our hearts.</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192139:246"/>for violating the Liberty of a Citizen. They knew this was Capital to the greateſt of their Deputies, what then would it be to the Decurions of one Colonie?

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:192139:249"/>Satan raiſeth by oppoſing it, imputed to it. This alſo is the maliciouſneſs of Chriſts Enemies, to lay the blame of Tumults upon holy and modeſt teachers, which they themſelves have procured. Certainly the Goſpel is not preached to this end, to ſtir up men to ſtrifes among themſelves, but rather that it may keep them in peace being reconciled to God. When Chriſt Liberally invites us there to come unto him, Satan and the wicked rage; therefore</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>might eaſily have defended themſelves, but it was requiſite for them to undergo this falſe ſlander for a time, and ſo long as they were not heard, ſilently to paſs it by. And the Lord by their example meant to teach us not to give place to ſlanders or falſe reports, but rather to ſtand ſtout in aſſerting the truth, being content to be evil ſpoken off, for what was well done. Therefore away with the perverſe wiſdom of ſome, who to eſcape falſe ſlanders, ſtand not to betray Chriſt and his Goſpel by their treacherous moderation, as if their good name were more precious than</hi> Pauls, <hi>and ſuch like, yea than the ſacred name of God, which is not free from Blaſphemies.</hi>

Neither doth Satan ceaſe to this day to ſpread ſuch miſts before mens dazled eyes. The Papiſts know very well, and are ſufficiently convinced before God, that it is more than falſe which they lay to our charge, That we overthrow all Civil Government, that Laws and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken away, that the Power of Kings is ſubverted by us. And yet they are not aſhamed to the end they may make the whole World to hate us, falſly to report us to be Enemies to publick Order.

This crime was altogether forged. Moreover if at any time Religion force us to reſist tyrannical Edicts, which forbid us to give due honour to Chriſt and due worſhip to God, we may then juſtly ſay for our ſelves that we do not violate the Power of Kings. For they are not ſo exalted that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour like Gyants to pull God out of his Throne. That excuſe of Daniels was true, that he had not offended the King, while yet he obeyed not his wicked Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither had injured mortal Man, becauſe he had preferred God to him. So let us faithfully pay to Princes their Tributes, let us be ready to any Civil Obedience, but if not content with that degree, they would pluck out of our hands the Fear and Worſhip of God, there is no reaſon why any ſhould ſay we deſpiſe them, becauſe we make more account of the Power and Majeſty of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I perceive that in all things ye are too Superſtitious. Eraſmus</hi> hath noted that in this diſcourſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed Admirable Policy and Prudence. Whoſe words ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they greatly illuſtrate this place, we ſhall not think it a trouble to inſert them. <q>The Apoſtle, ſaith, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> Preaching the Goſpel at <hi>Athens,</hi> had to do with men of diverſe Opinions; here were the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that deny that there are any Gods, or deny that they take any care of humane Concerns: And the <hi>Stoicks</hi> unprofitable hearers of Goſpel grace; for that they make their own Wiſe man equal with the Gods, and place Mans chief good in his own ſtrength. The reſt of the multitude in miſerable blindneſs, worſhipped all kinds of <hi>Demons</hi> for the true God. How doth he temper his Speech at ſuch a Theater? Does he begin to execrate their crime of Idolatry? Does he call the Gods of the <hi>Athenians, Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or which is worſe then theſe, <hi>wicked Spirits, hateful to God and Enemies to all humane kind?</hi> Does he upbraid them with their wicked Crimes, by which they were given over to a reprobate ſenſe, as he twiſts it in, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans?</hi> Nowiſe, for it was not as yet expedient, but very moderately ſaith, That he underſtood by their Images and Monuments, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were altogether given to Superſtition. The word Superſtition is ſmoother then idolatry, and this ſame he mitigates by the Comparative, <hi>too Superſtitious:</hi> And this again he leſſens by adding <hi>as if,</hi> what means this Civility of the Apoſtles? Whither does he look, what does he catch at, did he fear the <hi>Athenians?</hi> Not at all, but it is their gain that he deſigns and follows; he knew the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:192139:255"/>as the other Nations, to have been given to the worſhipping of Images, even before he came to <hi>Athens.</hi> But that he might not ſeem to have brought with him a bad report of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> or to be Inquiſitive in another common-wealth; he ſaith that he perceived their Superſtition, by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſet up in publick, and that not deſignedly, but paſſing by accidentally. Neither does he call them Idols or Monuments of Impiety, but in a ſmoother Term <hi>Sebasmata,</hi> which alſo is taken in a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And it was deſignedly that he ſaid that he ſaw an Altar with that Inſcription; <hi>to the unknown God.</hi> What did he do with this Policy, that he might make uſe of their readineſs to hear, if he would not ſeem to be the Author of new Gods, which by the <hi>Athenians</hi> was puniſhed with death, but he would Preach that which they long ago, though ignorantly worſhipped. Now conſider with what words he Preacheth the unknown God: He does not ſay, the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> did ſpeaking to the Jews, but with a diſcourſe ſo tempered that he might with patience be heard even by <hi>Ethnicks;</hi> God that made the World and all things therein.</q> 
                  <hi>Paul adds,</hi> Seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands; neither is he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing, ſeeing he giveth to all Life and breath and all things. <hi>Hitherto hath he ſaid nothing that may not be ſuffered, neither do you hear the Teſtimonies of the Prophets here, which</hi> Peter <hi>made uſe of to the Jews; but he produceth the Teſtimony of</hi> Aratus, for we are his offspring, <hi>not naming him indeed, but what was more fit to perſwade them,</hi> As, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> certain alſo of your own Poets have ſaid. <hi>Though I ſuſpect the word</hi> Poets <hi>hath been added by latter Authors, for this reaſon, that the moſt ancient Author</hi> Irenaeus, <hi>citing this place does not add</hi> Poets, <hi>nor yet</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:192139:255"/>Auguſtine. <hi>Now obſerve with what Prudence, he accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates this Teſtimony of</hi> Aratus <hi>to his purpoſe: If God be not far from every one of us, by whoſe favour we Live and Breath, he is not then Viſible or Corporeal, or perceptible by any ſenſe, far leſs then our Souls are, ſeeing he is as it were the Soul of our Soul. Then, if we be his Children, it becomes us not being Children to have low thoughts of ſo great a Father: For it is certain the Soul is the far nobler part of Man, without which the Body is nothing: but the Body of Man is better by far then Images of Wood, Stone, Braſs, Silver, Gold, in which there is no ſenſe of any thing, nor motion, neither were they made by God, but by the Tradeſman; therefore they who worſhip Images, they have that for a God, which is viler then the baſeſt part of Man. Ye ſee with how much caution, and with how much Temperance, he Demonſtrates the Worſhipping of Images not to be Religion, but Superſtition. Certainly here was room to be incenſed at the blindneſs of the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>who having learned theſe things from their Authors, yet would worſhip Dead and Dumb things inſtead of God. Yet neither here doth he ſpeak any ſharp Word: He refers the madneſs of former ages to the times, and Gods winking at them, that he might excuſe what had been done heretofore, by the ignorance in which God ſuffered men to be blinded for a time; only that they might now repent at the ſhining light of the Goſpel. Neither does he properly here direct his diſcourſe to the</hi> Athenians, <hi>but ſpeaks in general that he might the leſs offend.</hi> That all men, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> might every where repent, <hi>he ſheweth that a pardon for what was paſt, was ready for ſuch as would betake themſelves to better; otherwiſe that ſevere Judgment was near to ſuch as would deſpiſe ſo great a favour from God. Neither doth he ſpeak thus, We declare to you that Gods Judgment is at hand, and that they ought to flee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But God declares. No mention is made as yet of Chriſt, of whom they had no knowledge. Now a natural way of teaching begins with known things. Here obſerve,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:192139:256"/>Paul <hi>who in his Epiſtles with ſo loud a Trumpet, perſonated the Majeſty of Chriſt, how ſparingly he touches him. No mention of the Divine Nature, alſo as to the Croſs which was fooliſhneſs to the Nations, ſilence. He calls him only a Man, whom God hath ſet out in this World, that the truth being by him cleared, the Penitent ſhould be freely pardoned, and the unbelieving being now innexcuſable ſhould be juſtly puniſhed. Neither does he adduce the Teſtimonies of the Prophets here; but only with one argument proves what he ſaid, becauſe God raiſed him from the Dead. Only at the mentioning of the Reſurrection ſome mocked, others being more modeſt, ſaid, We will hear thee again of this matter. He who deſireth to be more fully taught, hath profited in ſome meaſure. Here alſo it ſeems the Apoſtles Diſcourſe was interrupted, his Auditors leaving him, neither would he preſs them any further.</hi> But departed from among them, <hi>ſaith</hi> Luke, <hi>waiting a more fit occaſion. Alſo this ſame happened by</hi> Paul<hi>'s Wiſdom, that he was neither miſuſed, nor railed at, nor hurt by any ſeizing upon him, but departed ſafe, but not without gain. Them who cleaved to him he more fully inſtructed, among which were</hi> Dionyſius, <hi>and a certain Woman named</hi> Damaris, <hi>and others with them. Hence it apears how great force a diſcourſe tempered with prudent meekneſs hath.</hi>

It ſeems that it was a Civil vow, that either <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Aquila</hi> took, ſuch as the Jews did many times like it. I will not ſhave my hair before I come to that place, which were the Pilgrims Vows. So <hi>Paul</hi> made a Vow to cut his hair when he came to <hi>Cenchrea.</hi> Of this kind were the Vows or Curſes which they took upon themſelves, not to take meat nor drink unleſs they did ſuch a thing.

                     <hi>Acts</hi> 23.12.</note> Yet there are many who underſtand this of the Holy Vow of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> by which ſome bound themſelves for a certain time, as others did forever. For ſo long as they were bound by this Vow, it was a heinous crime to ſhave their hair. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.5. But whereas there <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. the <hi>Nazarite</hi> having fulfilled his Vow, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſhave the hair of his head at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to put it in the fire, which is under the Sacrifice of the Peace-offering, and to offer Sacrifice unto God, This, while the Jews poſſeſſed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ought to be done at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the Tabernacle was ſeated. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius, thoſe Precepts with others concerning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, did not oblige them who lived without</hi> Jeruſalem. Laſtly, others refer this vow not to <hi>Pauls</hi> ſhaving of his head, but to his Sailing into <hi>Syria.</hi> 
                  <q>He Sailed into <hi>Syria, ſaith the Learned</hi> Samael Petit, that he might keep the feaſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and it was that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> vowed, therefore a little after, he told
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:192139:268"/>the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that he behoved by all means to keep the approaching feaſt at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But why muſt he do that <hi>by all means?</hi> It was not for that Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that obliged all to celebrate three Feaſts at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For he tarryed almoſt two years at <hi>Gorinth,</hi> and three whole years at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and went not to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to keep the Feaſt. What therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in this place, that he was put to it of neceſſity to go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to the Feaſt, he was put to it by his Vow, not that he was now any more bound by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law. But one may ask, why in the Hiſtory of <hi>Paul</hi>'s going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are theſe words inſerted, <hi>And having ſhorn his head at</hi> Cenchrea, And what was the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> did ſhave his head? We will eaſily give the reaſon, God willing, it is therefore to be noted what was <hi>Pauls</hi> cuſtom among the common People, to wit, he became a Jew to the Jews, as under the Law to theſe who were under the Law,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1.</note> from this uſual cuſtom we doubt not but <hi>Paul</hi> ſo long as he was among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did make much of his hair, for among the <hi>Greeks</hi> this was a ſign of a Free-born Man, as appears by the verſe of <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> which went in a Proverb.

                        <hi>For as much as it belongeth to free Perſons to let grow their hair.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As the ancient Maſters obſerve, but that the Jews had a contrary cuſtom, not to cheriſh their hair, but to ſhave it to the quick, appears from the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who for the Religion of their Vow, abſtained thirty days from ſhaving their hair, therefore they who were lyable by no Religion of a Vow to cheriſh their hair, they cheriſhed it not, but were ſhaved again and again or perhaps oftener every Month. Seeing therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> who let his hair grow according to the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:192139:268"/>cuſtom of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was going from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before he would looſe from the Port, laid by his hair, and ſhaved his head to the quick, after the manner of the Jews. For he doubted not to have to do with them at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> therefore he who reſembled the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> ſo long as he was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> would alſo reſemble the Jews, coming to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> their Metropolis.</q>

                  <hi>Of the Sect of the</hi> Nazarens. In the <hi>Greek, Hereſie of the</hi> Nazarens. That is to ſay, Thoſe who follow the Sect of the Chriſtians or embrace their Hereſie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies are, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> defines them, <hi>the Doctrines of Men, and Devils, ſpringing from itching Ears.</hi> Hereſie for the moſt part is ſaid to be, that Judgment and opinion which is choſen by any, whether it be invented by us, or received from another: Yet uſe has prevailed now, eſpecially among Chriſtians, that this word, that before was uſed either in a good or a bad ſenſe, is for the moſt part now uſed in a bad, to wit, for the chooſing of a falſe and perverſe opinion plainly and altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Word of God.

The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore abhorred the Doctrine of the Chriſtians, tho it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Law and the Prophets, as Heretical and perverſe, becauſe it diſſented from the common Faith of the Publick Church, which at that time was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church of God. So alſo at this very day, they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:192139:326"/>who follow the Appointments of Chriſt, are called Hereticks, if they vilifie and reject the errors of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Chriſtians, that are crept into the Church by cuſtom. Moreover, as the Learned <hi>Lud. de Dieu</hi> very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, <hi>That Christ was called</hi> Nazaraeos <hi>or</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renos, <hi>and his followers</hi> Nazaraioi, <hi>did not proceed from a miſtake of the Common People, as ſuppoſing him born at</hi> Nazareth, <hi>nor from the mockery of the Wicked, as account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a reproach to him, but from God's own purpoſe and Will, and the uſe of the Godly themſelves.

For when <hi>Agrippa</hi> the Elder reigned and governed <hi>Judea</hi> it ſelf, he is of opinion that the <hi>Jews</hi> payed Tribute, not to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to their own King; nor that any Procurator came from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The ſame <hi>Scaliger</hi> on <hi>Euſcbius, Num.</hi> MMLXXXVI. Agrippa <hi>the younger the ſeventh and laſt of the Kings of the Race of</hi> Herod, <hi>lived</hi> 30 <hi>years after the Deſtruction of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>his Kingdom continuing ſafe, which he poſſeſſed</hi> 26 <hi>years, and encreaſed by the acceſſion of ſome Towns through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of</hi> Veſpaſian. <hi>So far was the Fortune of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from cauſing any alteration in his Kingdom.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:192139:336"/>Perſon, or that he was deſtroyed together with</hi> Jeruſalem? <hi>But theſe things are both already confuted, as alſo they are with this Coin.</hi> ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΩΡ.

As if he had ſaid, But now I am Accuſed, becauſe I maintain the Hope of the Promiſe made to our Fathers. <hi>By Hope,</hi> Saith <hi>Wolzogenius, he ſeems to underſtand metonymically the things hoped for, as appears by what follows. Some expound that hope of the Reſurrection of the Dead, of which above,</hi> c. 23. v. 6. &amp;c. 24.15. <hi>But others take it for the Hope of the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Jews by the Meſſiah, or of Salvation to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Chriſt. Nor without reaſon; for altho here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> v. 8. <hi>there is expreſly mention made of the Raiſing of the Dead, yet that does not militate againſt this Opinion, which may be ſeen there. Again, The raiſing up of the Juſt that are dead, is comprehended in that hope of Salvation by Chriſt, as being of larger extent. Moreover, it cannot be clearly ſhewn, that the Promiſe of the Reſurrection of the Dead was made by God to the Fathers of the Jews, which is here immediately ſubjoyned. But it is manifeſt that it was made of Chriſt, not obſcurely, but expreſly, as we ſhall ſtraight ſee. To paſs by that, what is ſpoken in the following Verſe, can ſcarce be rightly ſaid of the hope of the Reſurrection, to wit, that the twelve Tribes of Iſrael hoped that they ſhould come to it; ſeeing there were many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe twelve Tribes, who had no perſwaſion of the hope of the Reſurrection of the dead, as the Sadduces, and thoſe who favoured their Opinion.</hi>

And although Chriſt, after he was raiſed from the Dead, was not ſhewn but to his Diſciples, yet it ſeems very likely from what happened to the watch of his Sepulchre, who being aſtoniſhed at the admirable approach of the bright Angel to his Sepulchre, at the time of his Reſurrection, told what was done there to the Chief Prieſts, and afterward being bribed with Mony, denied it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.4, 11, 15. that afterward by degrees the report of this matter ſpread amongſt Men, that the ſame was carried a great deal further
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:192139:347"/>by ſo many of Chriſt's Diſciples, who ſpoke it openly very confidently and conſtantly, as being Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thereof, nothing terrified with the vehement Afflictions they by reaſon thereof expoſed themſelves to.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:192139:359"/>the <hi>Latins</hi> call the <hi>Adriatick</hi> or <hi>Adrian</hi> Sea or Gulph. The Poets alſo call it <hi>Adria</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Adriacum,</hi> which anciently was called <hi>Atriacum,</hi> as alſo the City <hi>Atria,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 16 in theſe words. <hi>The</hi> Tuſcans <hi>began to make firſt out of</hi> Sagis <hi>all theſe Rivers and Ditches, diverting the Impetus of the River into the</hi> Adrian <hi>Marſhes, which are called the ſeven Seas, and made a famous Haven of</hi> Atria, <hi>a Town of the</hi> Tuſcans, <hi>from whence that was before called the</hi> Atriatick, <hi>which now is called the</hi> Adriatick <hi>Sea. Pliny</hi> ſpeaketh of the River <hi>Po,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Erida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> which emptied twenty Rivers with it ſelf into the Sea. But whether <hi>Adria</hi> and <hi>Atria</hi> were the ſame City we leave to the Learned to judge. <hi>Stephan. Byzantius</hi> thinketh that they were different Cities, for he mentions each of them in their peculiar place; but it is uſual with him to make two of one and the ſame City, as <hi>Thomas de Pinedo</hi> hath obſerved. But this is certain from <hi>Strabo, Ovid, Statius,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> that not only that Gulph which-lies betwixt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Corcyra</hi> is called <hi>Adria,</hi> or <hi>Adrian,</hi> and moſt uſually <hi>Adriatick,</hi> but that that name is extended even to the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> Procopius <hi>calls the Sea reaching from</hi> Methon <hi>to</hi> Sicily, <hi>and elſewhere from</hi> Cephalenia <hi>to</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria, <hi>by the name of</hi> Adria, <hi>and in another place he makes a part of it, the Gulf of</hi> Adria; <hi>and expreſly in his firſt of the</hi> Vandals, <hi>he placeth as well</hi> Gaulon <hi>as</hi> Melite <hi>in</hi> Adria.</p>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:192139:374"/>came a little after, that it diſcharged its Poiſon on the Tree, and that thereupon the Man died.</hi> So there is a ſort of Serpents among the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Giaria,</hi> which immediately kills.

Indeed the biting of a Viper is more pernicious, by reaſon of the Nature of the place or aliment, and if it bites faſting, or in the hotteſt Weather, and when it's provoked. For then its Bile being ſtirred up, the Poiſon is much ſtronger. Beſides, ſome Bodies, and in one and the ſame Body ſome Parts leſs reſiſt the Poiſon. Seeing therefore there are ſo many cauſes, why Vipers kill either quicker or ſlower by their biting, the time of their Death cannot certainly be determined.

For by him it is called <hi>Dicaea, Dicaearchia,</hi> and <hi>Potioli.</hi> In <hi>Potioli</hi> he ſaith that it was built by the <hi>Samians,</hi> and in <hi>Dicaea</hi> that it was a Colony of the <hi>Ionians.

But about the time of the War with <hi>Annibal,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ſent a Colony thither, and changing its former name <hi>Dicaearchia,</hi> they called it <hi>Potioli,</hi> from <hi>Putei,</hi> Wells.

                  <q>It is not commanded that they ſhould ſtop their Ears in the Aſſembly, or that all their ſenſes ſhould of their own accord be ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but it is a moſt ſad complaint, which is expreſſed after the manner of Men with a kind of Indignation and Imprecation. As if he had ſaid, Continue, ye Hearers, to Hear, and yet not underſtand, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my Teachers and their Threatnings, as hitherto ye have done, and ſee what will be the reſult of theſe things. For ye ſhall do nothing elſe by your ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs, but bring upon your ſelves lamentable Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and Deſtruction. This is the meaning of this Verſe, ſo that it is a complaint and ſad expoſtulation, becauſe they knowingly and willingly oppoſed the Word of God. For the Imperatives do not ſo much command them to do thoſe things, as they upbraid them, as done already, or to be done at all times, and they have the force of a threatning Propheſy. Therefore the Seventy Interpreters, as alſo Chriſt in his diſcourſe to his Apoſtles <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. reſolve them into Verbs of the Future Tenſe. <hi>In Hearing ye ſhall Hear, and not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand.</hi> Alſo, <hi>The Heart of this People is made fat.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20 referreth what is attributed to the Doctrine here, to the corrupt affections of the Nation, while he ſaith that the <hi>Jews</hi> petulantly rejected grace when offered. Therefore <hi>Clemens</hi> 1 <hi>Strom.</hi> ſaith rightly, where he explains the ſaying of Chriſt, That ſeeing they ſhould not ſee, and Hearing they ſhould not hear, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>They are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, not that ignorance is wrought in them by the Lord, (for it is not lawful to think ſo) but a Prophetical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of that which was to be, and ſignified that they would
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:192139:384"/>be inadvertant, not heeding thoſe things that were ſpoken.</hi> For neither does the Prophet Blind any People, nor does God, when he cauſeth Blindneſs in them do this efficaciouſly. But ſeeing he daily ſhewed them his Will, and moreover did many and that ſtupendious Miracles, yet they deſpiſed and made a mock of them all, God provoked with their ſtubbornneſs, withdrew himſelf from them, and ſo ſuffered them to wander and periſh blindfolded in their Darkneſs, and that by his juſt Judgment. He therefore upbraids them with this, that the Juſtice of God may be conſpicuous in puniſhing and caſting off the People. But what befel <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtopped their ears to his Propheſying, the ſame Chriſt foretold would be his own lot, when he came in the Fleſh.

            <head>Fridericus Spanhemius Filius HIS Diſputation on Baptiſm For the DEAD, Mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29.</head>
            <p>IF there be any place in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Writings much controverted, if any that has much puzled the Wits of the Learned, if any that is hard to be underſtood, this undoubtedly is one, wherein the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, when he is about to prove the Reſurrection, argues thus:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29.</note> 
               <hi>Otherwiſe what ſhall they do (if the dead are not at all raiſed) who are Baptized</hi>

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for the dead?</hi> Whence a twofold difficulty ariſes; 1. What is that Baptiſm <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>for the Dead:</hi> 2. How the Reſurrection is demonſtrated thence.</p>
            <p>In handling this difficult point, we ſhall uſe this method; to wit, firſt ſet down the different Opinions. 2. We ſhall ſubjoin our own Opinion, what we think the true meaning of the words, and the force of <hi>Pauls</hi> Reaſoning. As to the former we ſhall reduce
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192139:387"/>the Interpretations, both of the Ancient and Modern, into three Claſſes.</p>
            <div n="1" type="class">
               <head>CLASS 1. <hi>Of thoſe who underſtand the word</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of Baptiſmſtrictly ſo called, or the Sacrament of Baptiſm, variouſly divided among themſelves.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">I. NOr are Interpreters of the firſt Claſs agreed among themſelves; for ſome Neotericks, among whom <hi>Luther,
<note place="margin">The Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Luther, Hunnius Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Hunnius, Gerhardus,</hi> the Lutherans, <hi>Piſcator, Amyraldus,</hi> &amp;c. were of opinion that the Apoſtle in this place, had reſpect to the place where Baptiſm was adminiſtred to many, to wit, upon the dead, that is, upon the Sepulchres of the dead, the Tombs of the Martyrs, or Burying Places; and that for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimony that they were not afraid of Death, having a certain hope of the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is no doubt, but that if there were any certainty of ſuch a practice either among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> or elſewhere, in the firſt age of the Church, <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſoning would have been moſt plain. But there is nothing to evidence the uſe of this Rite in the Apoſtolick Age,
<note place="margin">Paraph. in loc.</note> as <hi>Amyraldus</hi> himſelf grants. <hi>There is no appearance of this practice in the Hiſtory of firſt Antiquity.</hi> And he himſelf ſaith, that ſome ſuch practice ſhould be ſuppoſed. But that is not enough, while there is no ſufficient proof for it. It is certain that they then uſed to Baptize, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there was plenty of Water; hence ſometimes they Baptized in Rivers, ſometimes in the High way, in Houſes, in Priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any difference of places. So the Ancient Church uſed to Baptize firſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192139:387"/>in Rivers, Lakes, Fountains, but afterwards in Fonts, Temples, Oratories, ſometimes in the Beds of the ſick. Indeed in the ſucceeding Age, as appears by <hi>Tertul.</hi> and <hi>Euſeb. &amp;c.</hi> the Chriſtians took the Reliques of the Martyrs from their Murderers, carefully interred them, and met at their Tombs, and prayed, and celebrated their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but no Writer, ſays a word of Baptizing there, even of that Age, much leſs of the Apoſtolick. 2. But further, Neither was there Water enough for Dipping their Bodies at the Tombs, nor could they build Fonts there more than Oratories. Beſides, the Martyrs in thoſe days, when the Apoſtle wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were fewer than that in every place they could meet at their Tombs; nor were Publick Meetings allowed in thoſe days. It may be objected, That the Burying-Places of Chriſtians were places <hi>under-ground,</hi> where they might ſecretly perform theſe Rites. But neither is there any evidence of ſuch ſpacious Burying-places among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> nor were theſe places made uſe of for meeting in, or that the Chriſtians went in unto the Burying-places till long after, when the Perſecution raged, whence they were called <hi>Twilight Meetings.</hi> 3. If this had been a Practice among ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it would have been altogether ſingular, not to ſay ſuperſtitious, to reſtrict the Sacrament of Baptiſm to the Sepulchres, without either Precept or Preſident of the Apoſtles for it. Neither would the Apoſtle from ſuch a practice have drawn a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Argument for the Reſurrection of the Dead. Laſtly, Neither would the Apoſtles words have been pertinent in this ſenſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III.
<note place="margin">The Opinion of ſome of the Ancients, and of <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Caſaub. Gretius,</hi> &amp;c.</note> The next is the Opinion of thoſe who thought that reſpect is had in theſe words to thoſe who were baptized, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>in ſtead, and place of the dead,</hi> as the Syriack has it, <hi>for them,</hi> or <hi>in their name,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> And that becauſe they thought that ſuch as died before they were baptized either did not riſe at all, or had not a happy Reſurrection. Hence they aſcribe that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to ſome <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were of ſome Note and Authority, and who performed this Vicarious Baptiſm for their Friends and Kinſmen that died without Baptiſm, either under the deceaſeds Bed, or within his Sepulchre; and they thought that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed enjoyed thereby ſome comfort till the day of the Reſurrection; and hence <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Ancient Church, <hi>of praying for the dead,</hi> had its Original. Now the force of the Argument is this, that ſuch had undertaken this pains in vain, yea fooliſhly, if the dead had been to continue ſo. Whence <hi>Jonas Schlightingius</hi> uſes this ſimile
<note n="*" place="margin">v. Com. ad loc.</note>: <hi>Who would dig up the Bowels of the Earth if there were no Gold to be had,</hi> &amp;c? Now that this was the practice of ſome, from whom the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes himſelf and his Followers, they ſay is plain by the Teſtimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Haer.</hi> 28.</note>, who attributes it to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who charges the <hi>Marcionites</hi> with it. Yea <hi>Joſ. Scalig.</hi> ſays, that even the Faithful, who were more ſimple, <hi>who had not the knowledge of God,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 34. practiſed it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But notwithſtanding that this Opinion is patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by ſo many Learned Men, yet there are not a few, and that very weighty Reaſons, why we ſhould not believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had reſpect thereto. And firſt, That Vicarious Baptiſm is of very uncertain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For <hi>Epiphanius</hi> relateth it as from the Report of others, being often too credulous. But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Hermas, Juſtin, Clemens Alex.</hi> Nor is <hi>Tertullian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the like practice of the <hi>Marcionites.</hi> But Learned Interpreters, and among them <hi>Ph. Priorius</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Tertul. de Reſ. c.</hi> 48.</note>, think that <hi>Tertullians</hi> words may be interpreted of the <hi>waſhing</hi> of the Body, or ſome other Rite, <hi>for the dead,</hi> uſed by ſome after the manner of the Heathens, which Cuſtom he compares to that of the Heathens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they prayed for the dead
<note n="*" place="margin">in <hi>Marc. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note>, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Feaſt of <hi>All Souls;</hi> which words <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath rendred of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm adminiſtred on the firſt of <hi>February,</hi> on which day they thought Chriſt was baptized. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is the firſt that maketh expreſs mention of that Marcioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Baptiſm: <hi>Having hid a living man under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſeds Bed, they came to the deceaſed, and asked him whether he would be baptized? Then he that was hid under the Bed anſwering for him,</hi> &amp;c. For poſſibly in <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtoms</hi> Age ſome had arrived to that height of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 2. Whereas <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath aſcribed that Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Baptiſm to ſome of the Faithful, he did it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Authority, for neither was that conjecture of Souls detained in Priſon till the day of Judgment, which he ſays it was founded upon, at the time when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote theſe things, but that it was in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Age, <hi>Guil. Rivet. Blondel</hi> and others have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated at large from the Sybillin Writings, and <hi>Irenaeus, Justin,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered either that Hypotheſis, or this Vicarious Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, both grievous Errors, to have thus grown up among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> without rebuke. For can it be ſuppoſed that he that was ſo careful to prevent Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that he would not ſuffer the leaſt to go without a ſharp Reproof, even thoſe that only infringed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and order, would have ſilently paſſed by ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192139:389"/>Errors as theſe, which ſhake the very Foundation? For thoſe whom he ſays <hi>had not the Knowledge of God,</hi> are the ſame whom he deſcribes, <hi>v.</hi> 12. who oppoſed the Reſurrection, to wit, the Sadduces and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, not thoſe weak Chriſtians. 3. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we think that this Error crept in in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> days, or rather <hi>Marcions,</hi> or <hi>Cerinths,</hi> yet there is no certainty that that Practice was in <hi>Pauls</hi> days, much leſs in the Church of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Now this to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is one of the firſt of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, dated at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as appeareth thereby
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 16.5, 18. Acts 19.10, 22.</note>, not at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as the ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bears. Now at that time, that is, in the year 53. or 54. or as <hi>Blondel,</hi> 52. in the Reign of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> were known to them, or this practice of theirs publiſht, is altogether contrary to Hiſtory to affirm. <hi>Marcion,</hi> ſaith <hi>Crellius</hi> on the place, <hi>aroſe in the days of</hi> John, that is, in the cloſe of the Firſt Century: Now how could <hi>Marcions</hi> Phrenſies be known by the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi> whom the Apoſtle wrote to half an Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For <hi>Marcion</hi> is ſaid to have been Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Anicetus,</hi> by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> or with <hi>Hyginus,</hi> according to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiarch in the middle of the ſecond Age. But we learn from <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> that the Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitick Baptiſm ſprung from a wreſted Interpretation of theſe words of the Apoſtle. Why might not, ſaith <hi>Dallaeus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>l. de Poen &amp; ſatisfact. c.</hi> 17.</note>, this practice ſpring up in <hi>Pauls</hi> days, ſeeing <hi>Cerinthus, according to</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, <hi>lived in the Apostles days and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> Peter <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem; which fault of <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Chronology, I wonder it ſhould have eſcaped the Pen of ſo accurate a Writer: For <hi>Cerinthus</hi> is related to have vented his Hereſies towards the cloſe of <hi>Johns</hi> days, according to <hi>Irenaeus, Dioniſius Alex.</hi> Fourthly, It might have been an eaſie thing for thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192139:389"/>who had not the knowledge of God, profane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, to have replyed to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that it was of little ſignificancy what Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick men either intended or did; and ſo to <hi>Pauls</hi> Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall they do?</hi> The Anſwer would have been very eaſie, that they were beſide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fed themſelves with fancies; after the ſame manner as if one that were going about to prove that Gold is made by Chymical operations, ſhould prove it thus. If it is not ſo, in vain do Chymiſts ſpend their ſubſtance and life about Furnaces; to which undoubtedly the denyer would anſwer, that ſuch men are not in their right wits. 5. Thoſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Schlightingius</hi> are very far from the purpoſe; That <hi>Paul</hi> argued the ſame way, as if one ſhould ſay, What ſhould they do who ſearch into the bowels of the Earth, build Ships, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if there be no Gold to be had in it, if we could not ſail over the Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Argument is drawn from a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, only, and lawful Medium, to an end plainly following, obvious to the ſenſes, and of means very coſtly and laborious, which to undertake without certainty of attaining the end, were extream madneſs. But can it be ſuppoſed that that Vicarious Baptiſm is ſuch a means for procuring a happy Reſurrection for the dead? 6. Nor is <hi>Grotius's</hi> conjecture more true, who alledgeth that the cuſtom of the <hi>Church of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead,</hi> ſprang from hence. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the firſt that makes mention of theſe Prayers about the Year 200. If there be any appearance of them among the Chriſtians before, you will find them firſt in the Pſeud-Sybillin Writings, when the ſecond Century was far ſpent; but the foundation of theſe Prayers, was an Opinion, that all Souls <hi>went down into Hell;</hi> hence ſprung Prayers for the deceaſed, not for the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Body, but for the reſt of the Soul, <hi>that at their departure out of this life they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192139:390"/>might not fall into the hands of evil Angels.</hi> But what dependance had theſe Prayers of the ſucceeding Age on that Baptiſm which they aſcribe to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the year 50. Suppoſe the Church prayed for the Dead in <hi>Tertullians</hi> days; were there therefore in <hi>Pauls</hi> days, ſome that Baptized themſelves for the Dead? Theſe and other things the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> was pleaſed to ſuppoſe which much tend to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Popery.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for dead,</hi> that is, as if dead, about to die, at the inſtant of Death, and that in hopes of the Reſurrection: Or, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for the ſtate of the dead,</hi> that it might go well with them, that they might have a happy entrance thereupon. Which Interpretation is firſt to be read in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> 
                  <q>But others rightly interpret this ſaying of thoſe who at the Inſtant of Death, if they were yet Catechumens, were before their Death waſhed with the Holy Laver, in this hope of the Reſurrection.</q> Several other learned men, both Ancient and Modern have patronized this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whom for <hi>Brevities</hi> ſake I omit. Now that they were not of one ſort who were thus baptized, may be gathered from the ſame perſons; for ſome were thus baptized <hi>out of neceſſity,</hi> Death preventing a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof in ſuch Catechumens, or thoſe lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or diſeaſes alſo hindring their dipping, and performing the wonted Rites of Baptiſm; others <hi>of purpoſe</hi> differred it, imagining that by Baptiſm only the ſins committed before it was adminiſtred were waſhed away; which the Ancients have alſo reported of the Emperors <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But we conceive that the Apoſtle intended

<note place="margin">The Opinion of <hi>Chryſoſtom, Peluſiot, Theophyl.</hi> &amp;c. alſo of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr,</hi> J. <hi>Forbes Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> &amp;c.</note> The 5th Interpretation is of thoſe who ſay the words have alluſion both to the Rite of Confeſſion that was previous to Baptiſm, and to a Type of the Reſurrection repreſented in Baptiſm; in which Expoſition <hi>Chryſtom</hi> is at a great deal of pains: A Breviate of which take briefly. Firſt he thinks that <hi>Paul</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Confeſſion that was previous to Baptiſm, which the Teachers required <hi>of thoſe that were to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> In which Confeſſion thoſe that were to be initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe Holy Rites, having firſt ſaid over the Articles of the Creed, in Concluſion did alſo profeſs their belief of <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and <hi>the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> Which Confeſſion when they had made they were Baptized into the ſame Faith. The other thing which he thinks the Apoſtle had reſpect to, was a moſt plain repreſentation of the Reſurrection of the Dead, in the very act of Baptizing; he calls it an Image, Sign, Symbol: That after the ſame manner as thoſe that were to be initiated profeſſed <hi>by their words</hi> their belief of the Reſurrection, ſo they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the very ſame thing by the very Rite of Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by the act of Immerſion firſt, and then Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of the Baptiſmal Water; which were a plain Type of the Reſurrection of the Dead. Whence he thus illuſtrates both St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, and the words themſelves. 1. It's certain that <hi>ſin brought in Death,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:192139:392"/>whence ſin being done away by Remiſſion, Death is ſo alſo, for in as much as he that is to be Baptized profeſſeth his belief of the <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> he muſt of neceſſity acknowledge the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is another Confeſſion, to wit, <hi>I believe that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> which if it were not, what we are asked and anſwer there would be a mere deluſion. 3. Hence it is added in the ſame Confeſſion, <hi>and into Life Everlaſting,</hi> leſt it ſhould be thought that it ſhould tend to Death, again, as <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s did. 4. But that Rite of <hi>Immerſion,</hi> &amp; <hi>Emerſion</hi> or <hi>coming out</hi> of the ſacred Font again, was for no other end but to be a Symbol <hi>of their going down into the Grave,</hi> and <hi>returning out of the ſame.</hi> Hence the ſaid <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thus Paraphraſes the words of the Apoſtle. 1. If there be no reſurrection, <hi>what ſhall they do that are Baptized,</hi> that is, to what purpoſe are they Baptized? <hi>What need was there at all of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> when the deed did not follow? All, ſaith he, were a meer ſcene, illuſion, deception. Alſo, if there ſhall be no Reſurrection, <hi>how can we Command them to believe thoſe things which we do not grant?</hi> Again, if there were no ſuch Reſurrection, to what purpoſe is that Type, that Baptiſmal Symbol, whereby they are dipped into the Water, to be preſently brought up again? 2.

               <p n="10">X. But by the leave of ſo many Learned men, we think that the Apoſtle had reſpect to no ſuch thing; neither to the praevious Confeſſion, nor to the Rite of Baptiſm it ſelf. And that the Apoſtle had no reſpect to the former, to wit previous Confeſſion, appears by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192139:393"/>the following Reaſons. 1. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſuppoſes the ſame uſe of the Apoſtles Age, and that of his own. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> days there was a Symbol in that form; there was then praerequired to Baptiſm ſuch a ſolemn Recitation; therein alſo there was expreſs mention of the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> To which were added by a praevious Rite, a Renunciation of the Devil, and of Pomp, Exorciſm, Inſufflation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unction, Praeguſtation of Milk and Honey; add the time when Baptiſm was adminiſtred, which <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> ſaith was on the Eve of <hi>Eaſter</hi> or <hi>Whitſuntide.</hi> And theſe he calls in the ſame place things <hi>not to be ſpoken,</hi> and <hi>tremendous,</hi> and hence that he durſt not expreſs the Apoſtles mind, <hi>becauſe of thoſe that were not initiated.</hi> But there is no certainty of the uſe of any ſuch Rites in the Apoſtles days. Many Articles were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively inſerted in the Creed, by reaſon of Hereticks. In their days there was only a Confeſſion of ſins, then a Confeſſion of Jeſus, and of God the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, as appears by the Writings of the Apoſtles, and <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr. 2. But neither from a belief of Remiſſion of ſins, was the Reſurrection of the Dead neceſſarily inferred: And the Pſeud-Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles might eaſily have replied, that hence indeed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Aboliſhing of ſin and Everlaſting Death, Peace of Conſcience, Felicity of the Soul, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> but by no means that of the Body. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſeems not to ſpeak of a Rite of Baptiſm Common to all, but of a Baptiſm that was ſingular and peculiar to ſome. Hence he does not ſay in the firſt Perſon, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Why are we Baptized for the Dead? As he uſes at other times, when the Predicate is ſuch as concerns all, as even in this very Chapter, <hi>Our Preaching is vain; your Faith is vain; We are of all Men moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> &amp;c. But here he ſpeaks in the third Perſon, <hi>What ſhall they do who are Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Neither
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192139:393"/>will any ſay that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="15">XV. But theſe things do neither agree to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Age, nor the Argument of this place, nor the Apoſtles words. 1. This Learned man has reſpect either to the <hi>deed</hi> of them that were baptized, who took upon them the name of ſome deceaſed perſon in Baptiſm; or to the deed of Parents, when they brought Infants to the Sacred Font. If the former, there is no proof, that ſuch changed their former name, and took another, to wit, that of a deceaſed Apoſtle or Martyr. But if this Learned perſon ſay that the Parents uſed to name their Children that were baptized, after the deceaſed Martyrs, there is no more certainty of that practice in <hi>Pauls</hi> days; the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192139:395"/>greateſt part of them that were then baptized, were adult perſons; and if there had been any Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, when whole Families were, had they no name before?

<note place="margin">The Opinion of <hi>Lewis de Dieu.</hi>
                  </note> The 7th Opinion is that of <hi>Lewis de Dieu.</hi> He ſuppoſes, 1. That <hi>the Dead</hi> are not here indifferently deſigned, but ſuch as died in the Lord. And 2. That Baptiſm is a Seal of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as alſo of the Covenant that is made with the Living, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was ſuch a Seal, even to the <hi>Dead,</hi> the Church triumphant, in ſo far as it ſtill expects a full accompliſhment of the Promiſes in the bleſſed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Whence he ſays the Apoſtles meaning was this: As many as are baptized in the Church, are not only baptized for themſelves, but alſo <hi>for the Dead,</hi> not indeed to procure them any advantage by their Baptiſm, but yet <hi>to eſtabliſh continually the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant,</hi> and to renew that Promiſe made to the Dead, <hi>That God is their God,</hi> and hence, <hi>That they live by the Promiſe, and that they ſhall ſometimes actually live by the Reſurrection. If therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Dead were not to riſe again, in vain would the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be baptized for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">XVII. But theſe ſuppoſitions are more ingenious than ſatisfactory, &amp; neither agree with ſimplicity of ſpeech, nor the force of <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument. We grant indeed, that the Dead ſpoken of there, are thoſe who died in the Faith of Chriſt, and conſequently of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Nor do we deny but Baptiſm in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is <hi>a Seal of the Reſurrection,</hi> or that thereby the Promiſe is eſtabliſhed, <hi>that God will be their God.</hi> But 1. The Pſeud-Apoſtles might have rejoyned, that Baptiſm is indeed the Seal of the Remiſſion of ſins, and conſequently of the firſt Reſurrection, but by no means of that of Bodies. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> would then have ſpoken of a Baptiſm common to the whole Church,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192139:396"/>which we have already proved to be falſe. 3. <hi>The Church Triumphant</hi> had no need of that daily Seal applied on Earth: She now in a great meaſure enjoys the Promiſes, living actually, not only by Promiſe, and ſufficiently aſſured of the accompliſhment of its glory by Unition with the Body, by its fruition of Inchoate Glory, its continual beholding God, the Angels, and Chriſt its Redeemer, &amp; who at laſt will be its Judge. 4. Had the Apoſtle intended any ſuch thing, he might have expreſt it much more plainly thus: <hi>What do we, who are baptized for this end, that we may ſeal the Promiſe of the Covenant, that God is the God of the Living?</hi> Or, <hi>Why are we baptized for a confirmation or ſeal of the Reſurrection of the Dead, of thoſe who are aſleep in Chriſt?</hi>

                  </note> The Eighth Opinion is that of <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> in his Annotations on this place.

<note place="margin">It's Refuted.</note> But 1. That expreſſion, <hi>What will they do who are baptized?

If the Apoſtle had reſpect to them in ſpecial, who before their Baptiſm with Water were dead to ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the life of Righteouſneſs, why did he ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſign them, who are baptized?

<note place="margin">Matth. 25.13.

               <p n="21">XXI. Which truly agree ſufficiently with the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> without any wreſting, as it ſeems.

Yea, it was rather after their Example, in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Blood of Chriſt, for a Seal of the waſhing away of their ſins. 3. But neither could this Baptiſm be accounted the Original of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Martyrs,</hi> which afterwards obtained in the Ancient Church. This had its Original in the heat of the Perſecutions, by reaſon of the Multitude, Courage and Conſtancy of the Martyrs, out of their ſingular affection to them, and that they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to Emulation, by Baptized Believers, that met at their Burying-places to pray, and not to be baptized.

               <p n="3">III. To recount which is enough to refute them. 1. We grant that that Rite of waſhing the Dead was ſometimes in uſe. It was formerly uſual among the <hi>Egyptians, Greeks, Romans,</hi> as appears by <hi>Homer, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; &amp;c. Anna</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Dido</hi>'s dead Body, ſaith, <hi>Water to bath the wounds.</hi> It is certain that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahumedans</hi> at this day are very ſtiff hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this Cuſtom, whether they waſh at home, or in the Burying-places. The <hi>Benjanenſes</hi> carefully waſh the dead Bodies with Water, as in <hi>H. Lord,</hi> and <hi>T. Herbert.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Pegu,</hi> as <hi>Balbius</hi> ſays, Thoſe of <hi>Siam,</hi> as <hi>J. Schouten,</hi> the <hi>Chinenſes,</hi> as <hi>Mendoza,</hi> the <hi>Formoſans,</hi> according to late Relations; Thoſe in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192139:398"/>Southern <hi>Africk,</hi> in <hi>Congo, Angola, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>T. Herbert;</hi> beſides Lotion they uſed alſo Unction, even in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, whence Perfuming and Embalming, as the <hi>Chinneſes</hi> ſometimes preſerve Bodies that are not buried till three years after. They added alſo <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which is even at this day in uſe in <hi>Siam,</hi> and other Idolatrous Places. Now we cannot underſtand by any proof, that theſe had reſpect to the Reſurrection, eſpecially being uſed by thoſe who knew nothing of it. Why therefore might not that waſhing be uſed as the laſt Teſtimony of Honour to the deceaſed, for the Ornament of their Bodies, and ſeemly ſight, &amp; longer Preſervation of them, eſpecially as a Symbol of the Purity of their Minds? So alſo many believed that they were purged from the remaining Uncleanneſs contracted from the Living, that ſo they might be preſented pure to the Gods. Moreover, that of the Diſciples to <hi>Tabitha</hi> was rather out of Jewiſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, than out of any Chriſtan view of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Whence the Apoſtles Argument would have been leſs ſtringent, eſpecially among the Greeks and Philoſophers. For to the Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall they do</hi> who ſo purge dead Bodies? the Anſwer might have been obvious, that there were ſeveral Reaſons, without reſpect to the Reſurrection, and they might have produced the forenamed. 3. If <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is this Queſtion of the Apoſtle to be confounded with the other, <hi>What ſhall become of them?</hi> He might have ſaid ſignificantly, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to what purpoſe are the Dead waſhed, baptized?</hi> 4. Nor is that leſs wreſted to render, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>as Dead,</hi> or, <hi>after Death.</hi> Why might not the Apoſtle have expreſſed the latter by an uſual ſpeech? But none of the Greeks ever expreſſed it ſo. By the

               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. We will not now examine <hi>Paul</hi>'s reſpect to this Legal Rite. But whether this was the reaſon of its Inſtitution, which this Learned man aſſerts, is more doubtful. He ſuppoſes it to be inſtituted on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe the Dead were irreverently treated by the Living; which was neither evident of thoſe Iſraelites, to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> gave out the Law, nor of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192139:400"/>the Egyptians, nor any Civiliz'd Nations; yea on the contrary, they ſhewed them all reverence, as witneſs their waſhing, anointing, embalming them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially the Egyptians, from whom the Iſraelites came forth. 2. Neither did this Reverence to them among the Gentiles, proceed from any knowledge of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: For they did not believe it. 3. The trueſt cauſe of this Legal Expiation was a Ceremonial Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs contracted by any touching of a dead. Body as a thing unclean, to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rint a horrour of Death, and hence of Sin the cauſe of it, and to ſhadow out the Neceſſity of Spiritual Cleanſing. What <hi>Schmidius</hi> aſſigns for the cauſe of it, it meerly precarious. But 4. They were alſo Unclean according to the Law, and were to be purified who touched the Carcaſſes of Beaſts. Was that becauſe they ſhould be alſo reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſed? Or were theſe alſo to riſe again? He will ſay that that was not done for Beaſts, but for Men. But this is ridiculous, for then the Legiſlator would have ſhewn in this how much the dead Body of a Man differs from that of a Beaſt, and ſuffered this to be ſo uſed without Expiation. 5. If this Baptiſm was inſtituted for this end, to expiate ſin, and to have pointed at the Expiation performed by Chriſt, it could not be ſaid to point out only the Reſurrection, and ſo would not have been in vain if there had been none: And ſo to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall they do who are baptized?</hi> To what purpoſe? it might be anſwered, they expiate ſin, or typifie the Expiation that. Chriſt ſhall make for it.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Some ſeem to have more ſimply ſtated this Alluſion of <hi>Paul</hi>'s: To wit, that <hi>thoſe who were defiled by the Dead,</hi> were legally accounted as dead themſelves, and that defilement was a kind of Civil Death, a Symbol of Spiritual Death, and pollution by ſin: That the Tabernacle of God, to which it was not lawful for the thus polluted to approach, was a Type of that

               <p n="2">II.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192139:401"/>reſt of Souls, than to the Reſurrection of Bodies. But ſeeing the ground on which they build this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, hath been ſo often overthrown by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, I think it not worth the while to ſay any more of it.</p>
               <p n="3">III.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpon. ad Jac.

Whence it is manifeſt, that this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is drawn from abſurdity, which the Apoſtle further expatiates.

               <p n="5">V. But notwithſtanding the Arguments for this Opinion, the following difficulties hinder me from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting thereto. 1. It ſeems a very great doubt, why the Apoſtle uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in that Figurative ſenſe, for <hi>to be afflicted,</hi> which he is never found to have done elſewhere? Why might not he have uſed the

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he does in other places? eſpecially when his Speech was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who were not accuſtomed to that kind of ſpeaking, in that Epiſtle, in which it frequently occurs in its proper ſignification, and on that Argument in which nothing ſhould have been ſpoken ambiguouſly, or which might be liable to the cavils or wreſtings of Seducers. 2. Beſides, the word is never uſed in this ſenſe without ſomething to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it. So Chriſt addeth the Verbale, <hi>to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with his Baptiſm;</hi>

And although it may be ſaid, that the Noun is virtually contained in the Verb, and ſometimes is omitted by the Hebrews, yet there is a different Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an Aequivocal Verb, which taken ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes any thing elſe, and cannot be drawn to this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſenſe, without ſome ſuch reſtrictive Noun added to it. 3. Add, that that is the very thing in Queſtion, whether the Apoſtle in the following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes uſes the ſame Medium or Argument. There is no neceſſity of it either in the words or the connexion of them: And why might not the Apoſtle argue firſt from other mens deeds, which would have been vain if there had been no Reſurrection, and then from his own ſufferings, which without it were, 'twould have been meer madneſs to have undergone. And in this all the Ancients and Modern agree. And the Apoſtle who before had drawn his Argument from others, now draws it from himſelf, <hi>Why are we in jeopardy?</hi> Elſe he would have ſaid, <hi>Why are we alſo baptized</hi> with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192139:402"/>the ſame Baptiſm? 4.

               <p n="1">I. OF all the foregoing Interpretations, two ſeem to me more probable than the reſt. One of which is that of <hi>Baptiſm of the Croſs,</hi> Afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſo that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, be rendred <hi>on the account of the Dead,</hi> to wit, for their Cauſe, and the Doctrine of their Reſurrection. Nor would I have receded from this Opinion, ſave on the account of the difficulties I now ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The other is that of the Legal Waſhing <hi>for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192139:403"/>Dead,</hi> by touching whom they were defiled. Of which Interpretation we ſhall now give our Judgment briefly. Take it thus: If there is no Reſurrection, <hi>what ſhall they do who are baptized,</hi> or waſhed, <hi>&amp;c. for the Dead,</hi> by touching whom they were defiled, and accounted as dead? What means that Rite of Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſeven days before they could enter the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or Temple? If the Dead are not raiſed, if that Rite was not a Type of the laſt Reſurrection, or the Glorification of Bodies by which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Heavenly Temple?</p>
               <p n="3">III. And ſo there ſeems nothing in the Apoſtles ſpeech either forced or wreſted. For, 1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is often the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is, for, or by reaſon of the Dead. 3. Nor is that unuſual, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>What ſhall they do?</hi> when the Argument is drawn from abſurdity; nor is the uſe and end of a thing otherwiſe underſtood. So <hi>Paul</hi> in another place, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Add, that if <hi>Paul</hi> had reſpect to any Rite, there is nothing more fitting than to ſay, he had reſpect to one of Divine Inſtitution. And ſo much the more, becauſe then there is ſome manifeſt Analogy with the Reſurrection. And why ſhould he have alluded to a Rite meerly Humane, or ſuperſtitious, or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192139:403"/>or in which there is no ſuch Analogy to be ſeen? Yea <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaith, that theſe different Waſhings under the Law were nothing elſe but a ſhadow <hi>of the good things to come,</hi> and Types of Heavenly things.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Yet there are not a few things that may be objected to the contrary. For, 1. When the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſuch Ablution, he expreſſes it by the words <gap reason="foreign">

And if he had a mind, he might have had more plain Symbols, or Teſtimonies, or Examples out of the Old Teſtament than that to prove the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. There is no ſufficient certainty that that Rite <hi>of Sprinkling</hi> was inſtituted to point out the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

               <p n="8">VIII. 4. It is certain that the Gentiles alſo every where accounted that touching of the Dead as a thing unclean, which was to be expiated by Ablution.

                  </gap>. Yet I need not ſay any thing to it, ſave that poſſibly there were ſome among that multitude of baptized perſons, who more openly and plainly profeſſed that <hi>Dead,</hi> that <hi>Crucified Perſon</hi> in Baptiſm, as the Sanctifier of their own Death, and the moſt certain Pledge of their Reſurrection: Although ſome are not pleaſed to reſtrict that general Phraſe of the Apoſtle's (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) to ſome few baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But we do not hinder, if any think this a weighty difficulty, or the foregoing Enallage harſh. And therefore the following Interpretation may be judged plainer, it being alſo ours, which we prefer as the moſt ſimple, and not labouring under any of the former difficulties.</p>
               <p>Take it therefore briefly thus: Thoſe <hi>dead</hi> perſons on <hi>whoſe account</hi> ſome may be ſaid to have been baptized, to wit, many Martyrs, and other Saints deceaſed, who received with a couragious, conſtant and chearful mind, all kind of puniſhments, yea death it ſelf, whether vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by perſecution, or natural by ſickneſs, in hope of a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Which fortitude and conſtancy of mind in theſe <hi>dead</hi> who ſo died in the Lord, while many beheld with their Eyes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>evolved in their Minds, obſerving no ſuch thing in their Gentiles, they were thereby induced to embrace the Faith of Chriſt, and deſired to be baptized. Hence <hi>Paul, What ſhall they do who are baptized for the dead?</hi> whoſe Triumph over Death they obſerved?</p>
               <p>In which Interpretation there is 1. Nothing remote from the Words and Phraſe of the Apoſtle. For ſo <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeech is moſt plain and ſimple; <hi>Thoſe who are baptized</hi> initiated by Baptiſm, <hi>for the dead,</hi> on their account, by their Impulſe, or for thoſe Examples of Hope and Conſtancy which they admired in the departed Saints.

Nor is there any thing alien from <hi>Pauls</hi> Scope and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For neither was there any greater comfort to thoſe who were a dying, either to Chriſt, or for Chriſt, amidſt their moſt grievous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Torments, than what proceeded from the hope of the Reſurrection. <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c. teach us this. With this hope, they were cheered up, as <hi>Job</hi> was of old, and <hi>Paul</hi> in that place fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the hearts of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with comfort, as alſo the <hi>Romans, Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, &amp;c.</hi> Whence both their Hope would have been in vain, and their Imitation of others that were baptized, if there had been no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Hence he ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

Inſinuating that ſuch were not only <hi>fooliſh,</hi> but alſo <hi>miſerable, if thoſe dead who ſlept in Chriſt,</hi> by beholding whom they were brought over to the Diſcipline of Chriſt, <hi>periſhed.</hi> Their miſery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded hence, becauſe out of a vain Opinion, and vain Hope of the Reſurrection, they muſt undergo all kind of Afflictions in this life, when once they are bound with the Sacrament of Baptiſm. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words alſo agree ſingularly well; for continuing his Argument, he immediately ſaith, <hi>Why are we in Jeopardy?</hi> Why do we expoſe our ſelves to the ſame dangers with thoſe dead, and which are the common Lot of all that are baptized. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> (as is believed) ſaith in his Anſwer to the Queſtions about the Reſurrection, <hi>If, according to your Opinion, the Doctrine of the Reſurrection is not true. how comes it to paſs that becauſe of it the Martyrs poſtpone their Life to death?</hi> 3. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it contrary to the Truth of Hiſtory. For we do not preca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuppoſe any practice. Some indeed may doubt whether at that time when the Apoſtle wrote theſe things, Martyrdom was ſo frequent and ſolemn, that many were thereby induced to embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith? But who can deny the famous Examples of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>James</hi> the Elder? Who can doubt but that amidſt ſo many Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo many Uproars ſtirred up by the Jews and Gentiles, in all places where there were Chriſtians, many died for the Faith of the Goſpel. For when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> about the Year of our Lord 56. 'twas above twenty years after the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyrs Death. Hence many of the Diſciples and Apoſtles are ſaid to have then received their Crown of Martyrdom. Nor are <hi>Paul:</hi> Exhortations to ſuffer Perſecutions, and to endure the utmoſt Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, with an undaunted Mind, from any other reaſon, but becauſe Martyrdom was then frequent. Yea in this very Chapter he calls them Falſe Witneſſes, if there were no Reſurrection, not without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, even to that laſt <hi>Teſtimony</hi> already ſealed, or to be ſealed by death, from whence they were called <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Again, that by thoſe Examples of Conſtancy and Confidence of the Reſurrection; the like
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192139:406"/>hope was kindled in many of the Jews, eſpecially of the Gentiles, and that this occaſioned their deſire of being baptized, ſeveral Fathers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie; <hi>Clemens</hi> and
<note n="*" place="margin">Hiſt. l. 11. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſay, that the Accuſer of <hi>James</hi> the Elder, was ſo amazed at his Conſtancy, that he immediately turned Chriſtian, and became a Martyr; <hi>both therefore were led out together to their Execution.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologetick ſaith, <hi>We are increaſt in number as often as we are led out by you. Words find not ſo many Diſciples, as Chriſtians do when they teach them by their deeds. That very Obſtinacy which you upbraid is a School-Miſtreſs. For who is not, by the Contemplation thereof, ſtirred up to ſearch what there is within? Who when he has enquired does not come over to us? Who when come over, does not deſire to ſuffer?</hi> But neither is it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to underſtand only the Martyrs by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but thoſe alſo who died (whatſoever way it were) in the thorough Faith of the Reſurrection. Under this Notion therefore are comprehended there all thoſe who (abſtracting from the caſe of Martyrdom) received death with a cheerful Mind, conſtant Faith, and certain hope of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to wit, that that which died would live again, and that which fell ſhould riſe again. Nor is there any doubt but many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who beheld this in them, would thereby be induced to embrace the Chriſtian Faith, and conſequently Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. And this is our Opinion, if the word <gap reason="foreign">

Whence I do not a little admire that in ſo great a Cloud of Interpreters, they turned aſide ſo much to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and far-ſought things, not taking notice of the moſt obvious.</p>
